<h3>THE WHITE HORSE CHAPLAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>The Bishop of Alden was practising his French
upon Arsene LaComb. It was undoubtedly good
French, this of M&rsquo;sieur the Bishop, Arsene assured
himself. It must be. But it certainly was
not any kind of French that had ever been spoken
by the folks back in Three Rivers.</p>
<p>Still, what did it matter? If Arsene could not
understand all that the Bishop said, it was equally
certain that the Bishop could not understand all
that Arsene said. And truly the Bishop was a
cheery companion for the long road. He took
his upsets into six feet of Adirondack snow, as
man and Bishop must when the drifts are soft
and the road is uncertain.</p>
<p>In the purple dawn they had left Lowville and
the railroad behind and had headed into the hills.
For thirty miles, with only one stop for a bite
of lunch and a change of ponies, they had pounded
along up the half-broken, logging roads. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
they were in the high country and there were no
roads.</p>
<p>Arsene had come this way yesterday. But a
drifting storm had followed him down from Little
Tupper, covering the road that he had made
and leaving no trace of the way. He had stopped
driving and held only a steady, even rein to keep
his ponies from stumbling, while he let the tough,
willing little Canadian blacks pick their own road.</p>
<p>Twice in the last hour the Bishop and Arsene
had been tossed off the single bobsled out into
the drifts. It was back-breaking work, sitting all
day long on the swaying bumper, with no back
rest, feet braced stiffly against the draw bar in
front to keep the dizzy balance. But it was the
only way that this trip could be made.</p>
<p>The Bishop knew that he should not have let
the confirmation in French Village on Little Tupper
go to this late date in the season. He had
arranged to come a month before. But Father
Ponfret&rsquo;s illness had put him back at that time.</p>
<p>Now he was worried. The early December
dark was upon them. There was no road. The
ponies were tiring. And there were yet twelve
bad miles to go.</p>
<p>Still, things might be worse. The cold was not
bad. He had the bulkier of his vestments and regalia
in his stout leather bag lashed firmly to the
sled. They could take no harm. The holy oils
and the other sacred essentials were slung securely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
about his body. And a tumble more or less in
the snow was a part of the day&rsquo;s work. They
would break their way through somehow.</p>
<p>So, with the occasional interruptions, he was
practising his amazing French upon Arsene.</p>
<p>Bishop Joseph Winthrop of Alden was of old
Massachusetts stock. He had learned the French
that was taught at Harvard in the fifties. Afterwards,
after his conversion to the Catholic
Church, he had gone to Louvain for his seminary
studies. There he had heard French of another
kind. But to the day he died he spoke his
French just as it was written in the book, and with
an aggressive New England accent.</p>
<p>He must speak French to the children in French
Village to-morrow, not because the children would
understand, but because it would please Father
Ponfret and the parents.</p>
<p>They were struggling around the shoulder of
Lansing Mountain and the Bishop was rounding
out an elegant period to the bewildered admiration
of Arsene, when the latter broke in with a
sharp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jomp, M&rsquo;sieur l&rsquo;Eveque, <i>jomp</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop jumped&ndash;&ndash;or was thrown&ndash;&ndash;ten
feet into a snow-bank.</p>
<p>While he gathered himself out of the snow and
felt carefully his bulging breast pockets to make
sure that everything was safe, he saw what had
happened.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>The star-faced pony on the near side had
slipped off the trail and rolled down a little bank,
dragging the other pony and Arsene and the sled
with him. It looked like a bad jumble of ponies,
man and sled at the bottom of a little gully, and
as the Bishop floundered through the snow to help
he feared that it was serious.</p>
<p>Arsene, his body pinned deep in the snow under
the sled, his head just clear of the ponies&rsquo;
heels, was talking wisely and craftily to them in
the <i>patois</i> that they understood. He was within
inches of having his brains beaten out by the quivering
hoofs; he could not, literally, move his head
to save his life, and he talked and reasoned with
them as quietly as if he stood at their heads.</p>
<p>They kicked and fought each other and the sled,
until the influence of the calm voice behind them
began to work upon them. Then their own craft
came back to them and they remembered the many
bitter lessons they had gotten from kicking and
fighting in deep snow. They lay still and waited
for the voice to come and get them out of this.</p>
<p>As the Bishop tugged sturdily at the sled to
release Arsene, he remembered that he had seen
men under fire. And he said to himself that he
had never seen a cooler or a braver man than this
little French-Canadian storekeeper.</p>
<p>The little man rolled out unhurt, the snow had
been soft under him, and lunged for the ponies&rsquo;
heads.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Up, Maje! Easee, Lisette, easee! Now!
Ah-a! Bien!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had them both by their bridles and dragged
them skilfully to their feet and up the bank.
With a lurch or two and a scramble they were all
safe back on the hard under-footing of the trail.</p>
<p>Arsene now looked around for the Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ba Golly! M&rsquo;sieur l&rsquo;Eveque, dat&rsquo;s one fine
jomp. You got hurt, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop declared that he was not in any
way the worse from the tumble, and Arsene turned
to his team. As the Bishop struggled back up
the bank, the little man looked up from his inspection
of his harness and said ruefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s bad, M&rsquo;sieur l&rsquo;Eveque. She&rsquo;s gone
bust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the frayed end of a broken trace in his
hand. The trouble was quite evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; asked the Bishop.
&ldquo;Have you any rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Dat&rsquo;s how I been one big fool, me.
I lef&rsquo; new rope on de sled las&rsquo; night on Lowville.
Dis morning she&rsquo;s gone. Some t&rsquo;ief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get on somehow,&rdquo; said the Bishop,
as he unbuckled part of the lashing from his bag
and handed the strap to Arsene. &ldquo;That will hold
until we get to the first house where we can get the
loan of a trace. We can walk behind. We&rsquo;re
both stiff and cold. It will do us good. Is it
far?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s Long Tom Lansing in de hemlocks,
&rsquo;bout quarter mile, maybe.&rdquo; The little man
looked up from his work long enough to point
out a clump of hemlocks that stood out black and
sharp against the white world around them. As
the Bishop looked, a light peeped out from among
the trees, showing where life and a home
fought their battle against the desolation of the
hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I donno,&rdquo; said Arsene speculatively, as he and
the Bishop took up their tramp behind the sled;
&ldquo;Dat Long Tom Lansing; he don&rsquo; like Canuck.
Maybe he don&rsquo; lend no harness, I donno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; he will surely,&rdquo; answered the Bishop
easily. &ldquo;Nobody would refuse a bit of harness
in a case like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was full dark when they came to where
Tom Lansing&rsquo;s cabin hid itself among the hemlocks.
Arsene did not dare trust his team off the
road where they had footing, so the Bishop
floundered his way through the heavy snow to
find the cabin door.</p>
<p>It was a rude, heavy cabin, roughly hewn out
of the hemlocks that had stood around it and
belonged to a generation already past. But it
was still serviceable and tight, and it was a home.</p>
<p>The Bishop halloed and knocked, but there was
no response from within. It was strange. For
there was every sign of life about the place.
After knocking a second time without result, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
lifted the heavy wooden latch and pushed quietly
into the cabin.</p>
<p>A great fire blazed in the fireplace directly opposite
the door. On the hearth stood a big black
and white shepherd dog. The dog gave not the
slightest heed to the intruder. He stood rigid, his
four legs planted squarely under him, his whole
body quivering with fear. His nose was pointed
upward as though ready for the howl to which
he dared not give voice. His great brown eyes
rolled in an ecstasy of fright but seemed unable
to tear themselves from the side of the room
where he was looking.</p>
<p>Along the side of the room ran a long, low
couch covered with soft, well worn hides. On it
lay a very long man, his limbs stretched out awkwardly
and unnaturally, showing that he had been
dragged unconscious to where he was. A candle
stood on the low window ledge and shone down
full into the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>At the head of the couch knelt a young girl,
her arm supporting the man&rsquo;s head and shoulder,
her wildly tossed hair falling down across his
chest.</p>
<p>She was speaking to the man in a voice low
and even, but so tense that her whole slim body
seemed to vibrate with every word. It was as
though her very soul came to the portals of her lips
and shouted its message to the man. The power
of her voice, the breathless, compelling strength
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
of her soul need seemed to hold everything between
heaven and earth, as she pleaded to the
man. The Bishop stood spellbound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, Daddy Tom! Come back, My
Father!&rdquo; she was saying over and over. &ldquo;Come
back, come back, Daddy Tom! It&rsquo;s not true!
God doesn&rsquo;t want you! He doesn&rsquo;t want to take
you from Ruth! How could He! It&rsquo;s not never
true! A tree couldn&rsquo;t kill my Daddy Tom!
Never, never! Why, he&rsquo;s felled whole slopes of
trees! Come back, Daddy Tom! Come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time which he could not measure the
Bishop stood listening to the pleading of the girl&rsquo;s
voice. But in reality he was not listening to the
sound. The girl was not merely speaking. She
was fighting bitterly with death. She was calling
all the forces of love and life to aid her in her
struggle. She was following the soul of her
loved one down to the very door of death. She
would pull him back out of the very clutches of
the unknown.</p>
<p>And the Bishop found that he was not merely
listening to what the girl said. He was going
down with her into the dark lane. He was echoing
every word of her pleading. The force of
her will and her prayer swept him along so that
with all the power of his heart and soul he prayed
for the man to open his eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl stopped. A great, terrible
fear seemed to grip and crush her, so that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
cowered and hid her face against the big, grizzled
white head of the man, and cried out and sobbed
in terror.</p>
<p>The Bishop crossed the room softly and touched
the girl on the head, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not give up yet, child. I once had some
skill. Let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned and looked up blankly at him.
She did not question who he was or whence he
had come. She turned again and wrapped her
arms jealously about the head and shoulders of
her father. Plainly she was afraid and resentful
of any interference. But the Bishop insisted
gently and in the end she gave him place beside
her.</p>
<p>He had taken off his cap and overcoat and he
knelt quickly to listen at the man&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>Life ran very low in the long, bony frame; but
there was life, certainly. While the Bishop fumbled
through the man&rsquo;s pockets for the knife that
he was sure he would find, he questioned the girl
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a little while ago,&rdquo; she answered,
in short, frightened sentences. &ldquo;My dog came
yelping down from the mountain where Father
had been all day. He was cutting timber. I ran
up there. He was pinned down under a limb.
I thought he was dead, but he spoke to me and
told me where to cut the limb. I chopped it away
with his axe. But it must be I hurt him; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
fainted. I can&rsquo;t make him speak. I cut boughs
and made a sledge and dragged him down here.
But I can&rsquo;t make him speak. Is he?&ndash;&ndash; Is
he?&ndash;&ndash; Tell me,&rdquo; she appealed.</p>
<p>The Bishop was cutting skilfully at the arm and
shoulder of the man&rsquo;s jacket and shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were all alone, child?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Where could you get the strength for all this?
My driver is out on the road,&rdquo; he continued, as
he worked on. &ldquo;Call him and send him for the
nearest help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose and with a lingering, heart-breaking
look back at the man on the couch, went out
into the snow.</p>
<p>The Bishop worked away deftly and steadily.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s shoulder was crushed hopelessly,
but there was nothing there to constitute a fatal
injury. It was only when he came to the upper
ribs that he saw the real extent of the damage.
Several of them were caved in frightfully, and it
seemed certain that one or two of them must have
been shattered and the splinters driven into the
lung on that side.</p>
<p>The cold had driven back the blood, so that
the wounds had bled outwardly very little. The
Bishop moved the crushed shoulder a little, and
something black showed out of a torn muscle under
the scapula.</p>
<p>He probed tenderly, and the thing came out in
his hand. It was a little black ball of steel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>While the Bishop stood there wondering at the
thing in his hand, a long tremor ran through the
body on the couch. The man stirred ever so
slightly. A gasping moan of pain escaped from
his lips. His eyes opened and fixed themselves
searchingly upon the Bishop. The Bishop
thought it best not to speak, but to give the man
time to come back naturally to a realisation of
things.</p>
<p>While the man stared eagerly, disbelievingly,
and the Bishop stood holding the little black ball
between thumb and fore-finger, Ruth Lansing
came back into the room.</p>
<p>Seeing her father&rsquo;s eyes open, the girl rushed
across the room and was about to throw herself
down by the side of the couch when her father&rsquo;s
voice, scarcely more than a whisper, but audible
and clear, stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Horse Chaplain!&rdquo; he said in a
voice of slow wonder. &ldquo;But I always knew he&rsquo;d
come for me sometime. And I suppose it&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop started. He had not heard the
name for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>The girl stopped by the table, trembling and
frightened. She had heard the tale of the White
Horse Chaplain many times. Her sense told her
that her father was delirious and raving. But he
spoke so calmly and so certainly. He seemed so
certain that the man he saw was an apparition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
that she could not think or reason herself out of
her fright.</p>
<p>The Bishop answered easily and quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lansing, I am the Chaplain. But I did
not think anybody remembered now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Lansing&rsquo;s eyes leaped wide with doubt
and question. They stared full at the Bishop.
Then they turned and saw the table standing in
its right place; saw Ruth Lansing standing by the
table; saw the dog at the fireplace. The man
there was real!</p>
<p>Tom Lansing made a little convulsive struggle
to rise, then fell back gasping.</p>
<p>The Bishop put his hand gently under the man&rsquo;s
head and eased him to a better position, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a chance, Lansing. I was driving
past and had broken a trace, and came in to
borrow one from you. You got a bad blow.
But your girl has just sent my driver for help.
They will get a doctor somewhere. We cannot
tell anything until he comes. It perhaps is not so
bad as it looks.&rdquo; But, even as he spoke, the
Bishop saw a drop of blood appear at the corner
of the man&rsquo;s white mouth; and he knew that it was
as bad as the worst.</p>
<p>The man lay quiet for a moment, while his eyes
moved again from the Bishop to the girl and the
everyday things of the room.</p>
<p>It was evident that his mind was clearing
sharply. He had rallied quickly. But the Bishop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
knew instinctively that it was the last, flashing rally
of the forces of life&ndash;&ndash;in the face of the on-crowding
darkness. The shock and the internal
hemorrhage were doing their work fast. The
time was short.</p>
<p>Evidently Tom Lansing realised this, for, with
a look, he called the girl to him.</p>
<p>Through the seventeen years of her life, since
the night when her mother had laid her in her
father&rsquo;s arms and died, Ruth Lansing had hardly
ever been beyond the reach of her father&rsquo;s voice.
They had grown very close together, these two.
They had little need of clumsy words between
them.</p>
<p>As the girl dropped to her knees, her eyes, wild,
eager, rebellious, seared her father with their terror-stricken,
unbelieving question.</p>
<p>But she quickly saw the stab of pain that her
wild questioning had given him. She crushed
back a great, choking sob, and fought bravely with
herself until she was able to force into her eyes
a look of understanding and great mothering tenderness.</p>
<p>Her father saw the struggle and the look,
and blessed her for it with his eyes. Then he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never blame me, Ruth, girl, will you?
I know I&rsquo;m desertin&rsquo; you, little comrade, right in
the mornin&rsquo; of your battle with life. But you
won&rsquo;t be afraid. I know you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>The girl shook her head bravely, but it was
clear that she dared not trust herself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ask this man here to look to you.
He came here for a sign to me. I see it. I see
it plain. I will trust him with your life. And so
will you, little comrade. I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m droppin&rsquo; out.
He&rsquo;ll take you on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saved my life once. So he gave you your
life. It&rsquo;s a sign, my Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl slipped her hands gently under his head
and looked deep and long into the glazing eyes.</p>
<p>Her heart quailed, for she knew that she was
facing death&ndash;&ndash;and life alone.</p>
<p>Obedient to her father&rsquo;s look, she rose and
walked across the room. She saw that he had
something to say to this strange man and that the
time was short.</p>
<p>In the doorway of the inner room of the cabin
she stood, and throwing one arm up against the
frame of the door she buried her face in it. She
did not cry or sob. Later, there would be plenty
of time for that.</p>
<p>The Bishop, reading swiftly, saw that in an instant
an irrevocable change had come over her.
She had knelt a frightened, wondering, protesting
child. A woman, grown, with knowledge of
death and its infinite certainty, of life and its infinite
chance, had risen from her knees.</p>
<p>As the Bishop leaned over him, Lansing spoke
hurriedly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew your name, Chaplain; or if I
did I forgot it, and it don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying. I don&rsquo;t need any doctor to tell
me. I&rsquo;ll be gone before he gets here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that day at Fort Fisher, when
Curtis&rsquo; men were cut to pieces in the second charge
on the trenches. They left me there, because it
was every man for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ball in my shoulder and another in my leg.
And you came drivin&rsquo; mad across the field on a
big, crazy white horse and slid down beside me
where I lay. You threw me across your saddle
and walked that wild horse back into our lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember? Dying men got up on
their elbows and cheered you. I lay six weeks in
fever, and I never saw you since. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, now,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;Our troop
came back to the Shenandoah, and I never knew
what&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That terrible, unforgettable day rolled back
upon him. He was just a few months ordained.
He had just been appointed chaplain in the Union
army. All unseasoned and unschooled in the
ways and business of a battlefield, he had found
himself that day in the sand dunes before Fort
Fisher. Red, reeking carnage rioted all about
him. Hail, fumes, lightning and thunder of battle
rolled over him and sickened him. He saw
his own Massachusetts troop hurl itself up against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the Confederate breastworks, crumple up on itself,
and fade away back into the smoke. He lost it,
and lost himself in the smoke. He wandered
blindly over the field, now stumbling over a dead
man, now speaking to a living stricken one: Here
straightening a torn body and giving water; there
hearing the confession of a Catholic.</p>
<p>Now the smoke cleared, and Curtis&rsquo; troops
came yelling across the flat land. Once, twice
they tried the trenches and were driven back into
the marshes. A captain was shot off the back of a
big white horse. The animal, mad with fright and
blood scent, charged down upon him as he bent
over a dying man. He grabbed the bridle and
fought the horse. Before he realised what he was
doing, he was in the saddle riding back and forth
across the field. Right up to the trenches the
horse carried him.</p>
<p>Within twenty paces of their guns lay a boy,
a thin, long-legged boy with a long beardless face.
He lay there marking the high tide of the last
charge&ndash;&ndash;the farthest of the fallen. The chaplain,
tumbling down somehow from his mount,
picked up the writhing boy and bundled him across
the saddle. Then he started walking back looking
for his own lines.</p>
<p>Now here was the boy talking to him across
the mists of twenty-five years. And the boy, the
man, was dying. He had picked the boy, Tom
Lansing, up out of the sand where he would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
died from fever bloat or been trampled to death
in the succeeding charges. He had given him life.
And, as Tom Lansing had said to his daughter, he
had given that daughter life. Now he knew what
Lansing was going to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you then,&rdquo; said Lansing. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know who you are now, Chaplain, or what
you are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on slowly, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d agiven you a
message that day you&rsquo;d have taken it on for me,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it had been to my mother, say:
You&rsquo;da risked your life to get it on to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I would,&rdquo; said the Bishop evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you would. That&rsquo;s what I think
of you,&rdquo; said Tom Lansing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went back South after the war,&rdquo; he began
again. &ldquo;I stole my girl&rsquo;s mother from her grandfather,
an old, broken-down Confederate colonel
that would have shot me if he ever laid eyes on
me. I brought her up here into the hills and she
died when the baby was just a few weeks old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a relation in the world that my
little girl could go to. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to die in half
an hour. But what better would she be if I lived?
What would I do with her? Keep her here and
let her marry some fightin&rsquo; lumber jack that&rsquo;d beat
her? Or see her break her heart tryin&rsquo; to make
a livin&rsquo; on one of these rock hills? She&rsquo;d fret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
herself to death. She knows more now than I
do and she&rsquo;d soon be wantin&rsquo; to know more.
She&rsquo;s that kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d ought to have her chance the way I&rsquo;ve
seen girls in towns havin&rsquo; a chance. A chance to
study and learn and grow the way she wants to.
And now I&rsquo;m desertin&rsquo;; goin&rsquo; out like a smoky
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a crime, a crime!&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;ever
to bring her mother up into this place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not think of all that then. No
man ever does,&rdquo; said the Bishop calmly. &ldquo;And
I will do my best to see that she gets her chance.
I think that&rsquo;s what you want to ask me, isn&rsquo;t it,
Lansing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you swear it?&rdquo; gasped Lansing, struggling
and choking in an effort to raise his head.
&ldquo;Do you swear to try and see that she gets a
chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will help me to do the best for her,&rdquo; said
the Bishop quietly. &ldquo;I am the Bishop of Alden.
I can do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the definiteness of a man who has heard a
final word, Tom Lansing&rsquo;s eyes turned to his
daughter.</p>
<p>Obediently she came again and knelt at his side,
holding his head.</p>
<p>To the very last, as long as his eyes could see,
they saw her smiling bravely and sweetly down
into them; giving her sacrament and holding her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
light of cheering love for the soul out-bound.</p>
<p>When the last twinging tremour had run
through the racked body, she leaned over and
kissed her father full on the lips.</p>
<p>Then her heart broke. She ran blindly out into
the night.</p>
<p>While the Bishop was straightening the body
on the couch, a young man and two women came
into the room.</p>
<p>They were Jeffrey Whiting and his mother and
her sister, neighbours whom Arsene had brought.</p>
<p>The Bishop was much relieved with their coming.
He could do nothing more now, and the
long night ride was still ahead of him.</p>
<p>He told the young man that the girl, Ruth, had
gone out into the cold, and asked him to find her.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting went out quickly. He had
played with Ruth Lansing since she was a baby,
for they were the only children on Lansing Mountain.
He knew where he would find her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whiting, a keen-faced, capable woman of
the hills, where people had to meet their problems
and burdens alone, took command at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she replied to the Bishop&rsquo;s question,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s nobody to send for. The Lansings
didn&rsquo;t have a relation living that anybody
ever heard of, and I knew the old folks, too, Tom
Lansing&rsquo;s father and mother. They&rsquo;re buried out
there on the hill where he&rsquo;ll be buried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some old soldiers down the West
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
Slope towards Beaver River. They&rsquo;ll want to
take charge, I suppose. The funeral must be on
Monday,&rdquo; she went on rapidly, sketching in the
programme. &ldquo;We have a preacher if we can
get one. But when we can&rsquo;t my sister Letty here
sings something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Lansing was a comrade of mine, in a
way,&rdquo; said the Bishop slowly. &ldquo;At least, I was
at Fort Fisher with him. I think I should like
to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you at Fort Fisher?&rdquo; broke in the
sister Letty, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;And
did you see Curtis&rsquo; colour bearer? He was killed
in the first charge. A tall, dark boy, Jay Hamilton,
with long, black hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had an old scar over his eye-brow.&rdquo;
The Bishop supplemented the description out of
the memory of that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got it skating on Beaver Run, thirty-five
years ago to-morrow,&rdquo; said the woman trembling.
&ldquo;You saw him die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dead when I came to him,&rdquo; said the
Bishop quietly, &ldquo;with the stock of the colour
standard still clenched in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was my&ndash;&ndash;my&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Sweetheart, she
wanted to say. But the hill women do not say
things easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the Bishop gently. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
She was a woman of his people.
Clearly as if she had taken an hour to tell it, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
could read the years of her faithfulness to the
memory of that lean, dark face which he had once
seen, with the purple scar above the eye-brow.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whiting put her arm protectingly about
her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; she questioned, hesitating
strangely. &ldquo;Are you the White Horse Chaplain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys called me that,&rdquo; said the Bishop.
&ldquo;Though it was only a name for a day,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was true, then?&rdquo; she said slowly, as if
still unready to believe. &ldquo;We never half believed
our boys when they came home from the
war&ndash;&ndash;the ones that did come home&ndash;&ndash;and told
about the white horse and the priest riding the
field. We thought it was one of the things men
see when they&rsquo;re fighting and dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jeffrey Whiting came back into the room
leading Ruth Lansing by the hand.</p>
<p>The girl was shaking with cold and grief. The
Bishop drew her over to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go now, child,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-morrow
I must be in French Village. Monday I will
be here again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our comrade is gone. Did you hear what he
said to me, about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up slowly, searchingly into the
Bishop&rsquo;s face, then nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, we must think and pray, child, that we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
may know how to do what he wanted us to do.
God will show us what is the best. That is what
he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God keep you brave now. Your friends here
will see to everything for you. I have to go
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed the room and laid his hand for a
moment on the brow of the dead man, renewing in
his heart the promise he had made.</p>
<p>Then, with a hurried word to Mrs. Whiting
that he would be back before noon Monday, he
went out to where Arsene and his horses were
stamping in the snow.</p>
<p>The little man had replaced the broken trace,
and the ponies, fretting with the cold and eager
to get home, took hungrily to the trail.</p>
<p>But the Bishop forgot to practise his French
further upon Arsene. He told him briefly what
had happened, then lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Now the Bishop remembered what Tom Lansing
had said about the girl. She knew more now
than he did. Not more than Tom Lansing knew
now. But more than Tom Lansing had known
half an hour ago.</p>
<p>She would want to see the world. She would
want to know life and ask her own questions from
life and the world. In the broad open space between
her eye-brows it was written that she would
never take anybody&rsquo;s word for the puzzles of the
world. She was marked a seeker; one of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
who look unafraid into the face of life, and demand
to know what it means. They never find
out. But, heart break or sparrow fall, they must
go on ever and ever seeking truth in their own
way. The world is infinitely the better through
them. But their own way is hard and lonely.</p>
<p>She must go out. She must have education.
She must have a chance to face life and wrest its
lessons from it in her own way. It did not
promise happiness for her. But she could go no
other way. For hers was the high, stony way of
those who demand more than jealous life is ready
to give.</p>
<p>The Bishop only knew that he had this night
given a promise which had sent a man contentedly
on his way. Somehow, God would show him how
best to keep that promise.</p>
<p>And when they halloed at Father Ponfret&rsquo;s
house in French Village he had gotten no farther
than that.</p>
<p>Tom Lansing lay in dignified state upon his
couch. Clean white sheets had been draped over
the skins of the couch. The afternoon sun looking
in through the west window picked out every
bare thread of his service coat and glinted on the
polished brass buttons. His bayonet was slung
into the belt at his side.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing sat mute in her grief at the head
of the couch, listening to the comments and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
stumbling condolences of neighbours from the
high hills and the lower valleys. They were good,
kindly people, she knew. But why, why, must
every one of them repeat that clumsy, monotonous
lie&ndash;&ndash; How natural he looked!</p>
<p>He did not. He did not. He did <i>not</i> look
natural. How could her Daddy Tom look natural,
when he lay there all still and cold, and would
not speak to his Ruth!</p>
<p>He was dead. And what was death&ndash;&ndash; And
why? <i>Why?</i></p>
<p>Who had ordered this? And <i>why?</i></p>
<p>And still they came with that set, borrowed
phrase&ndash;&ndash;the only thing they could think to say&ndash;&ndash;upon
their lips.</p>
<p>Out in Tom Lansing&rsquo;s workshop on the horse-barn
floor, Jacque Lafitte, the wright, was nailing
soft pine boards together.</p>
<p>Ruth could not stand it. Why could they not
leave Daddy Tom to her? She wanted to ask him
things. She knew that she could make him understand
and answer.</p>
<p>She slipped away from the couch and out of
the house. At the corner of the house her dog
joined her and together they circled away from the
horse-barn and up the slope of the hill to where
her father had been working yesterday.</p>
<p>She found her father&rsquo;s cap where it had been
left in her fright of yesterday, and sat down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
fondling it in her hands. The dog came and slid
his nose along her dress until he managed to snuggle
into the cap between her hands.</p>
<p>So Jeffrey Whiting found her when he came following
her with her coat and hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better put these on, Ruth,&rdquo; he said, as
he dropped the coat across her shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too cold here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew the coat around her obediently,
but did not look up at him. She was grateful for
his thought of her, but she was not ready to speak
to any one.</p>
<p>He sat down quietly beside her on the stump and
drew the dog over to him.</p>
<p>After a little he asked timidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Ruth? You can&rsquo;t
stay here. I&rsquo;ll tend your stock and look after the
place for you. But you just can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; she questioned finally. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going
to that Albany school next week. You said
you were all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was all ready. But I ain&rsquo;t going. I&rsquo;ll stay
here and work the two farms for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And not be a lawyer
at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t care anything about it any more,&rdquo;
he lied. &ldquo;I told mother this morning that I
wasn&rsquo;t going. She said she&rsquo;d have you come and
stay with her till Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; the girl faced the matter, looking
straight and unafraid into his eyes. &ldquo;And
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;You see, then
I&rsquo;ll be twenty. And you&rsquo;ll be old enough to
marry me,&rdquo; he hurried. &ldquo;Your father, you
know, he always wanted me to take care of you,
didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he pleaded, awkwardly but subtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it now,&rdquo;
he went on hastily. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll come home with
mother to-morrow, won&rsquo;t you? You know she
wants you, and I&ndash;&ndash;I never had to tell you that I
love you. You knew it when you wasn&rsquo;t any
higher than Prince here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I always knew it, and I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; the
girl answered levelly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad now, Jeff. But
I can&rsquo;t let you do it. Some day you&rsquo;d hate me
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth! You know better than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d never tell me; I know that. You&rsquo;d
do your best to hide it from me. But some day
when your chance was gone you&rsquo;d look back and
see what you might have been, &rsquo;stead of a humpbacked
farmer in the hills. Oh, I know. You&rsquo;ve
told me all your dreams and plans, how you&rsquo;re
going down to the law school, and going to be a
great lawyer and go to Albany and maybe to
Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all good for?&rdquo; said the boy
sturdily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay here with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>The girl did not answer. In the strain of the
night and the day, she had almost forgotten the
things that she had heard her father say to the
White Horse Chaplain, as she continued to call
the Bishop.</p>
<p>Now she remembered those things and tried to
tell them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That strange man that said he was the
Bishop of Alden told my father that he would see
that I got a chance. My father called him the
White Horse Chaplain and said that he had been
sent here just on purpose to look after me. I
didn&rsquo;t know there were bishops in this country. I
thought it was only in books about Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father said that I would want to go out
and see things and know things; that I mustn&rsquo;t be
married to a&ndash;&ndash;a lumber jack. He said it was
no place for me in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this man, this bishop, is going to send
you away somewhere, to school?&rdquo; he guessed
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I suppose that was it,&rdquo; said
the girl slowly. &ldquo;Yesterday I wanted to go so
much. It was just as father said. He had
taught me all he knew. And I thought the world
outside the hills was full of just the most wonderful
things, all ready for me to go and see and pick
up. And to-day I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down at the cap in her hands, at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
dog at her feet, and down the hillside to the little
cabin in the hemlocks. They were all she had
in the world.</p>
<p>The boy, watching her eagerly, saw the look
and read it rightly.</p>
<p>He got up and stood before her, saying pleadingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to count me, Ruth. You&rsquo;ve got
me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had so answered
her unspoken thought. Perhaps it was because
she was afraid of the bare world. Perhaps it was
just the eternal surrender of woman.</p>
<p>When she looked up at him her eyes were full
of great, shining tears, the first that they had
known since she had kissed Daddy Tom and run
out into the night.</p>
<p>He lifted her into his arms, and, together, they
faced the white, desolate world all below them
and plighted to each other their untried troth.</p>
<p>When Tom Lansing had been laid in the white
bosom of the hillside, and the people were dispersing
from the house, young Jeffrey Whiting
came and stood before the Bishop. The Bishop&rsquo;s
sharp old eyes had told him to expect something of
what was coming. He liked the look of the boy&rsquo;s
clean, stubborn jaw and the steady, level glance
of his eyes. They told of dependableness and
plenty of undeveloped strength. Here was not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
boy, but a man ready to fight for what should be
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth told me that you were going to take
her away from the hills,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;To a
school, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a promise to her father,&rdquo; said the
Bishop, &ldquo;that I would try to see that she got the
chance that she will want in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I love her. She&rsquo;s going to marry me in
the Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop was surprised. He had not
thought matters had gone so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; he asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty in April.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have some education?&rdquo; the Bishop suggested.
&ldquo;You have been at school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what Tom Lansing taught me and Ruth.
And last Winter at the Academy in Lowville. I
was going to Albany to law school next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are giving it all up for Ruth,&rdquo; said
the Bishop incisively. &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy winced, but caught himself at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make any difference about that. I
want Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ruth? What does she want?&rdquo; the
Bishop asked. &ldquo;You are offering to make a sacrifice
for her. You are willing to give up your
hopes and work yourself to the bone here on these
hills for her. And you would be man enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
never to let her see that you regretted it. I believe
that. But what of her? You find it hard
enough to give up your chance, for her, for love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that you are asking her to give
up her chance, for nothing, for less than nothing;
because in giving up her chance she would
know that she had taken away yours, too. She
would be a good and loving companion to you
through all of a hard life. But, for both your
sakes, she would never forgive you. Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me to give her up. If she went
out and got a start, she&rsquo;d go faster than I could.
I know it,&rdquo; said the boy bitterly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d go away
above me. I&rsquo;d lose her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not asking you to give her up,&rdquo; the
Bishop returned steadily. &ldquo;If you are the man
I think you are, you will never give her up. But
are you afraid to let her have her chance in the
sun? Are you afraid to let her have what you
want for yourself? Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked steadily into the Bishop&rsquo;s eyes
for a moment. Then he turned quickly and
walked across the room to where Ruth sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give it up, Ruth,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Albany to school. I can&rsquo;t give it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up at him, and said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have tried to lie, Jeff; though
it&rsquo;s just like you to put the blame on yourself. I
know what he said. I must think.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>The boy stood watching her eyes closely. He
saw them suddenly light up. He knew what that
meant. She was seeing the great world with all
its wonderful mysteries beckoning her. So he
himself had seen it. Now he knew that he had
lost.</p>
<p>The Bishop had put on his coat and was ready
to go. The day was slipping away and before
him there were thirty miles and a train to be
caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not be hurried, my children,&rdquo; he
said, standing by the boy and girl. &ldquo;The Sacred
Heart Academy at Athens is the best school
this side of Albany. The Mother Superior will
write you in a few days, telling you when and
how to come. If you are ready to go, you will go
as she directs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been a good, brave little girl. A
soldier&rsquo;s daughter could be no more, nor less.
God bless you now, and you, too, my boy,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>When he was settled on the sled with Arsene
and they were rounding the shoulder of Lansing
Mountain, where the pony had broken the trace,
he turned to look back at the cabin in the hemlocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I have set two
ambitious, eager souls upon the high and stony
paths of the great world. Should I have left them
where they were?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never know whether I did right or not.
Even time will mix things up so that I&rsquo;ll never be
able to tell. Maybe some day God will let me
see. But why should he? One can only aim
right, and trust in Him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>THE CHOIR UNSEEN</h3>
</div>
<p>Ruth Lansing sat in one of the music rooms
of the Sacred Heart convent in Athens thrumming
out a finger exercise that a child of six would have
been able to do as well as she.</p>
<p>It was a strange, little, closely-crowded world,
this, into which she had been suddenly transplanted.
It was as different from the great world
that she had come out to see as it was from the
wild, sweet life of the hills where she had ruled
and managed everything within reach. Mainly it
was full of girls of her own age whose talk and
thoughts were of a range entirely new to her.</p>
<p>She compared herself with them and knew that
they were really children in the comparison.
Their talk was of dress and manners and society
and the thousand little and big things that growing
girls look forward to. She knew that in any
real test, anything that demanded common sense
and action, she was years older than they. But
they had things that she did not have.</p>
<p>They talked of things that she knew nothing
about. They could walk across waxed floors as
though waxed floors were meant to be walked on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
They could rise to recite lessons without stammering
or choking as she did. They could take reproof
jauntily, where she, who had never in her
life received a scolding, would have been driven
into hysterics. They could wear new dresses just
as though all dresses were supposed to be new.
She knew that these were not things that they had
learned by studying. They just grew up to them,
just as she knew how to throw a fishing line and
hold a rifle.</p>
<p>But she wanted all those things that they had;
wanted them all passionately. She had the sense
to know that those were not great things. But
they were the things that would make her like
these other girls. And she wanted to be like
them.</p>
<p>Because she had not grown up with other girls,
because she had never even had a girl playmate,
she wanted not to miss any of the things that they
had and were.</p>
<p>They baffled her, these girls. Her own quick,
eager mind sprang at books and fairly tore the
lessons from them. She ran away from the girls
in anything that could be learned in that way.
But when she found herself with two or three of
them they talked a language that she did not know.
She could not keep up with them. And she
was stupid and awkward, and felt it. It was not
easy to break into their world and be one of them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>Then there was that other world, touching the
world of the girls but infinitely removed from it&ndash;&ndash;the
world of the sisters.</p>
<p>That mysterious cloister from which the sisters
came and gave their hours of teaching or duty and
to which they retreated back again was a world all
by itself.</p>
<p>What was there in there behind those doors
that never banged? What was there in there
that made the sisters all so very much alike?
They must once have been as different as every
girl is different from every other girl.</p>
<p>How was it that they could carry with them
all day long that air of never being tired or fretted
or worried? What wonderful presence was there
behind the doors of that cloistered house that
seemed to come out with them and stay with them
all the time? What was the light that shone in
their faces?</p>
<p>Was it just because they were always contented
and happy? What did they have to be happy
about?</p>
<p>Ruth had tried to question the other girls about
this. They were Catholics. They ought to
know. But Bessie Donnelly had brushed her
question aside with a stare:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sisters always look like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Ruth did not ask any more. But her mind
kept prying at that world of the sisters behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
those walls. What did they do in there? Did
they laugh and talk and scold each other, like people?
Or did they just pray all the time? Or
did they see wonderful, starry visions of God and
Heaven that they were always talking about?
They seemed so familiar with God. They knew
just when He was pleased and especially when He
was displeased.</p>
<p>She had come down out of her hills where
everything was so open, where there were no mysteries,
where everything from the bark on the trees
to the snow clouds on Marcy, fifty miles away,
was as clear as a printed book. Everything up
there told its plain lesson. She could read the
storm signs and the squirrel tracks. Nothing had
been hidden. Nothing in nature or life up there
had ever shut itself away from her.</p>
<p>Here were worlds inside of worlds, every one of
them closing its door in the face of her sharp,
hungry mind.</p>
<p>And there was that other world, enveloping all
the other lesser worlds about her&ndash;&ndash;the world of
the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago those two words had meant
to her a little green building in French Village
where the &ldquo;Canucks&rdquo; went to church.</p>
<p>Now her day began and ended with it. It was
on all sides of her. The pictures and the images
on every wall, the signs on every classroom door.
The books she read, the talk she heard was all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
filled with it. It came and went through every
door of life.</p>
<p>All the inherited prejudices of her line of New
England fathers were alive and stirring in her
against this religion that demanded so much.
The untrammelled spirit that the hills had given
her fought against it. It was so absolute. It was
so sure of everything. She wanted to argue with
it, to quarrel with it. She was sure that it must
be wrong sometimes.</p>
<p>But just when she was sure that she had found
something false, something that she knew was not
right in the things they taught her, she was always
told that she had not understood. Some one was
always ready to tell her, in an easy, patient,
amused way, that she had gotten the thing wrong.
How could they always be so sure? And what
was wrong with her that she could not understand?
She could learn everything else faster and more
easily than the other girls could.</p>
<p>Suddenly her fingers slipped off the keys and her
hands fell nervelessly to her sides. Her eyes were
blinded with great, burning tears. A wave of intolerable
longing and loneliness swept over her.</p>
<p>The wonderful, enchanting world that she had
come out of her hills to conquer was cut down
to the four little grey walls that enclosed her.
Everything was shut away from her. She did not
understand these strange women about her.
Would never understand them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>Why? Why had she ever left her hills, where
Daddy Tom was near her, where there was love
for her, where the people and even the snow and
the wild winds were her friends?</p>
<p>She threw herself forward on her arms and
gave way utterly, crying in great, heart-breaking,
breathless sobs for her Daddy Tom, for her home,
for her hills.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock Sister Rose, coming to see that
the music rooms were aired for the evening use,
found Ruth an inert, shapeless little bundle of
broken nerves lying across the piano.</p>
<p>She took the girl to her room and sent for the
sister infirmarian.</p>
<p>But Ruth was not sick. She begged them only
to leave her alone.</p>
<p>The sisters, thinking that it was the fit of homesickness
that every new pupil in a boarding school
is liable to, sent some of the other girls in during
the evening, to cheer Ruth out of it. But she
drove them away. She was not cross nor pettish.
But her soul was sick for the sweeping freedom
of her hills and for people who could understand
her.</p>
<p>She rose and dragged her little couch over to
the window, where she could look out and up to
the friendly stars, the same ones that peeped down
upon her in the hills.</p>
<p>She did not know the names that they had in
books, but she had framed little pet names for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
them all out of her baby fancies and the names had
clung to them all the years.</p>
<p>She recognised them, although they did not
stand in the places where they belonged when she
looked at them from the hills.</p>
<p>Out among them somewhere was Heaven.
Daddy Tom was there, and her mother whom she
had never seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the night, from Heaven it
seemed, there came stealing into her sense a sound.
Or was it a sound? It was so delicate, so illusive.
It did not stop knocking at the portals of the ear
as other sounds must do. It seemed, rather, to
steal past the clumsy senses directly into the spirit
and the heart.</p>
<p>It was music. Yes. But it was as though the
Soul of Music had freed itself of the bondage and
the body of sound and notes and came carrying its
unutterable message straight to the soul of the
world.</p>
<p>It was only the sisters in their chapel gently
hymning the <i>Salve</i> of the Compline to their Queen
in Heaven.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing might have heard the same subdued,
sweetly poignant evensong on every other
night. Other nights, her mind filled with books
and its other business, the music had scarcely
reached her. To-night her soul was alive. Her
every sense was like a nerve laid bare, ready to be
thrilled and hurt by the most delicate pressures.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>She did not think of the sisters. She saw the
deep rose flush of the windows in the dimly lighted
chapel across the court, and knew vaguely, perhaps,
that the music came from there. But it carried
her beyond all thought.</p>
<p>She did not hear the words of the hymn.
Would not have understood them if she had heard.
But the lifting of hearts to <i>Our Life, our Sweetness
and our Hope</i> caught her heart up into a
world where words were never needed.</p>
<p>She heard the cry of the <i>Banished children of
Eve</i>. The <i>Mourning and weeping in this vale
of tears</i> swept into her soul like the flood-tide of
all the sorrow of all the world.</p>
<p>On and upwards the music carried her, until she
could hear the triumph, until her soul rang with
the glory and the victory of <i>The Promises of
Christ</i>.</p>
<p>The music ceased. She saw the light fade from
the chapel windows, leaving only the one little
blood-red spot of light before the altar. She lay
there trembling, not daring to move, while the
echo of that unseen choir caught her heartstrings
and set them ringing to the measure of the heart
of the world.</p>
<p>It was not the unembodied cry of the pain and
helplessness but the undying hope of the world
that she had heard. It was the cry of the little
blind ones of all the earth. It was the cry of
martyrs on their pyres. It was the cry of strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
men and valiant women crushed under the forces
of life. And it was the voice of the Catholic
Church, which knows what the soul of the world
is saying. Ruth Lansing knew this. She realised
it as she lay there trembling.</p>
<p>Always, as long as life was in her; always,
whether she worked or laughed, cried or played;
always that voice would grip her heart and play
upon it and lead her whether she would or no.</p>
<p>It would lead her. It would carry her. It
would send her.</p>
<p>Through all the long night she fought it. She
would not! She would not give up her life, her
will, her spirit! Why? Why? Why must she?</p>
<p>It would take her spirit out of the freedom of
the hills and make it follow a trodden way. It
would take her life out of her hands and maybe
ask her to shut herself up, away from the sun and
the wind, in a darkened convent. It would take
her will, the will of a soldier&rsquo;s daughter, and break
it into little pieces to make a path for her to walk
upon!</p>
<p>No! No! No! Through all the endless
night she moaned her protest. She would not!
She would not give in to it.</p>
<p>It would never let her rest. Through all her
life that voice of the Choir Unseen would strike
the strings of her heart. She knew it.</p>
<p>But she would not. Never would she give in
to it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>In the morning, even before the coming of the
dawn, the music came again; and it beat upon her
worn, ragged nerves, and tore and wrenched at
her heart until she could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>The sisters were taking up again the burden and
the way of the day.</p>
<p>She could not stand it! She could not stay
here! She must go back to her hills, where there
was peace for her.</p>
<p>She heard the sister going down to unlock the
street door so that Father Tenney could walk in
when it was time and go up to the chapel for the
sisters&rsquo; early mass.</p>
<p>That was her chance! The sisters would be in
chapel. The girls would be still in their rooms.</p>
<p>She dressed hastily and threw her books into a
bag. She would take only these and her money.
She had enough to get home on. The rest did
not matter.</p>
<p>When she heard the priest&rsquo;s step pass in the
hall, she slipped out and down the dim, broad
stairs.</p>
<p>The great, heavy door of the convent stood
like the gate of the world. It swung slowly, deliberately,
on its well-oiled, silent hinges.</p>
<p>She stood in the portal a moment, drinking
hungrily the fresh, free air of the morning that
had come down from her hills. Then she fled
away into the dawn.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>The sun was just showing over Lansing mountain
as Jeffrey Whiting came out of his mother&rsquo;s
house dragging a hair trunk by the handle. His
uncle, Cassius Bascom, drove up from the barn
with the team and sled. Jeffrey threw his trunk
upon the sled and bent to lash it down safe. It
was twenty-five miles of half broken road and
snowdrifts to Lowville and the railroad.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting was doing what the typical
American farm boy has been doing for the last
hundred years and what he will probably continue
to do as long as we Americans are what we are.
He is not always a dreamer, your farm boy, when
he starts down from his hills or his cross-roads
farm to see the big world and conquer it. More
often than you would think, he knows that he is
not going to conquer it at all. And he is not, on
the other hand, merely running away from the
drudgery of the farm. He knows that he will
probably have to work harder than he would ever
have worked on the farm. But he knows that he
has things to sell. And he is going down into the
markets of men. He has a good head and a
strong body. He has a power of work in him.
He has grit and energy.</p>
<p>He is going down into the markets where men
pay the price for these things that he has. He is
going to fight men for that price which he knows
his things are worth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>Jeffrey&rsquo;s mother came out carrying a canvas
satchel which she put on the sled under Cassius
Bascom&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kick that, Catty,&rdquo; she warned, &ldquo;Jeff&rsquo;s
lunch is in it. And, Jeff, don&rsquo;t you go and check
it with the trunk.&rdquo; There was just a little catch
in the laugh with which she said this. She was
remembering a day more than twenty years before
when she had started, a bride, with big, lumbering,
slow-witted, adoring Dan Whiting, Jeffrey&rsquo;s
father, on her wedding trip to Niagara Falls, with
their lunch in that same satchel. Dan Whiting
checked the satchel through from Lowville to Buffalo,
and they had nearly starved on the way. It
was easy to forgive Dan Whiting his stupidity.
But she never quite forgave him for telling it on
himself when they got back. It had been a standing
joke in the hills all these years.</p>
<p>She was just a typical mother of the hills. She
loved her boy. She needed him. She knew that
she would never have him again. The boys do
not come back from the market place. She knew
that she would cry for him through many a lonely
night, as she had cried all last night. But she was
not crying now.</p>
<p>Her deep grey eyes smiled steadily up into his
as she stretched her arms up around the neck of
her tall boy and drew his head down to kiss her.</p>
<p>He was not a dull boy. He was quick of heart.
He knew his mother very well. So he began with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the old, old lie; the lie that we all tried to tell
when we were leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only be a little while, Mother. You
won&rsquo;t find the time slipping by, and I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew it was a lie. All the mothers of boys
always knew it was a lie. But she backed him up
sturdily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, Jeff. Don&rsquo;t worry about me.
You&rsquo;ll be back in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Letitia Bascom came hurrying out of the
house with a dark, oblong object in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Jeff Whiting, I know you just
tried to forget this on purpose. It&rsquo;s too late to
put it in the trunk now; so you&rsquo;ll just have to put
it in your overcoat pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey groaned in spirit. It was a full-grown
brick covered with felt, a foot warmer. Aunt
Letty had made him take one with him when he
went down to the Academy at Lowville last winter,
and he and his brick had furnished much of the
winter&rsquo;s amusement there. The memory of his
humiliations on account of that brick would last a
lifetime. He wondered why maiden aunts could
not understand. His mother, now, would have
known better. But he dutifully put the thing into
the pocket of his big coat&ndash;&ndash;he could drop it into
the first snowback&ndash;&ndash;and turned to kiss his aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about them hall bedrooms in Albany,&rdquo;
she lectured. &ldquo;Make your landlady heat
it for you every night.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>A noise in the road made them all turn.</p>
<p>Two men in a high-backed, low-set cutter were
driving into the yard.</p>
<p>It was evident from the signs that the men
had been having a hard time on the road. They
must have been out all night, for they could not
have started from anywhere early enough to be
here now at sunrise.</p>
<p>Their harness had been broken and mended in
several places. The cutter had a runner broken.
The horses were cut and bloody, where they had
kicked themselves and each other in the drifts.</p>
<p>As they drove up beside the group in the yard,
one of the men shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is there any place we can put in here?
We&rsquo;ve been on that road all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive in onto the barn floor, and come in and
warm yourselves,&rdquo; said Mrs. Whiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogers,&rdquo; said the man who had spoken, addressing
the other, &ldquo;if I ever get into a place that&rsquo;s
warm, I&rsquo;ll stay there till spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rogers laid the lines down on the dashboard of
the cutter and stepped stiffly out into the snow.
He swept the group with a sharp, a praising eye,
and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the one to talk to here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting stepped forward naturally and
replied with another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rogers, a large, square-faced man, with a stubby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
grey moustache and cold grey eyes, looked the
youth over carefully as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a man that knows this country and can
get around in it in this season. I was brought up
in the country, but I never saw anything like this.
I wouldn&rsquo;t take a trip like this again for any
money. I can&rsquo;t do this sort of thing. I want a
man that knows the country and the people and
can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going away now,&rdquo; said Jeffrey
slowly, &ldquo;but Uncle Catty here knows the people
and the country better than most and he can go
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man looked doubtfully at the little, oldish
man on the sled. Then he turned away decisively.
Uncle Cassius, his kindly, ugly old face
all withered and puckered to one side, where a
splinter of shell from Fort Fisher had taken away
his right eye, was evidently not the kind of man
that the big man wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked Jeffrey
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Albany Law School,&rdquo; said Jeffrey promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unstrap the trunk, young man. You&rsquo;re not
going. I&rsquo;ve got something for you right here at
home that&rsquo;ll teach you more than ten law schools.
Put both teams into the barn,&rdquo; the big man commanded
loudly.</p>
<p>Jeffrey stood still a moment, as though he would
oppose the will of this brusque stranger. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
knew that he would not do so. In that moment
something told him that he would not go to law
school; would never go there; that his life was
about to take a twist away from everything that he
had ever intended.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whiting broke the pause, saying simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the broad, low kitchen, while Letitia Bascom
poured boiling tea for the two men, Rogers, cup
in hand, stood squarely on the hearth and explained
himself. The other man, whose name
does not matter, sank into a great wooden chair
at the side of the fire and seemed to be ready to
make good his threat of staying until spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I represent the U. &amp; M. railroad. We are
coming up through here in the spring. All these
farms have to be given up. We have eminent domain
for this whole section,&rdquo; said Rogers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jeffrey. &ldquo;The
railroad can&rsquo;t run <i>all over</i> the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But the road will need the whole strip
of hills for timber. They&rsquo;ll cut off what is standing
and then they&rsquo;ll stock the whole country with
cedar, for ties. That&rsquo;s all the land&rsquo;s good for,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting&rsquo;s mouth opened for an answer
to this, but his mother&rsquo;s sharp, warning glance
stopped him. He understood that it was his place
to listen and learn. There would be time enough
for questions and arguments afterward.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now these people here won&rsquo;t understand what
eminent domain means,&rdquo; the big man went on.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make it clear to you, young man.
I know who you are and I know more about you
than you think. I&rsquo;m going to make it clear to you
and then I&rsquo;m going to send you out among them
to make them see it. They wouldn&rsquo;t understand
me and they wouldn&rsquo;t believe me. You can make
them see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that I&rsquo;ll believe you?&rdquo;
asked Jeffrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got brains. You don&rsquo;t have to <i>believe</i>.
I can <i>show</i> it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting was a big, strong boy, well accustomed
to taking responsibilities upon himself.
He had never been afraid of anything and this
perhaps had given him more than the average
boy&rsquo;s good opinion of himself. Nothing could
have appealed to him more subtly than this man&rsquo;s
bluff, curt flattery. He was being met man to
man by a man of the world. No boy is proof
against the compliment that he is a man, to be
dealt with as a man and equal of older, more experienced
men. Jeffrey was ready to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what an option is?&rdquo; the man
began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Rogers, in a manner that
seemed to confirm his previous judgment of
Jeffrey&rsquo;s brains. &ldquo;Now then, the railroad has got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
to have all these farms from Beaver River right
up to the head of Little Tupper Lake. I say these
people won&rsquo;t know what eminent domain means.
You&rsquo;re going to tell them. It means that they can
sell at the railroad&rsquo;s price or they can hold off
and a referee will be appointed to name a price.
The railroad will have a big say in appointing
those referees. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I see,&rdquo; said Jeffrey. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No buts at all about it, young man,&rdquo; said Rogers,
waving his hand. &ldquo;The people have got to
sell. If they give options at once&ndash;&ndash;within thirty
days&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;ll get more than a fair price for their
land. If they don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;if they hold off&ndash;&ndash;their
farms will be condemned as forest land. And you
know how much that brings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You people will be the first. You can ask almost
anything for your land. You&rsquo;ll get it.
And, what is more, I am able to offer you, Whiting,
a very liberal commission on every option
you can get me within the time I have said. This
is the thing that I can&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s the thing that I
want you to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do it. I know you will, when you get
time to think it over. Here are the options,&rdquo; said
the big man, pulling a packet of folded papers
out of his pocket. &ldquo;They cover every farm in
the section. All you have to do is to get the
people to write their names once. Then your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
work is done. We&rsquo;ll do the rest and your commissions
will be waiting for you. Some better
than law school, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say,&rdquo; Jeffrey stammered, &ldquo;say, that
means, why, that means my mother and the folks
here, why, they&rsquo;d have to get out; they&rsquo;d have to
leave their home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Rogers easily. &ldquo;A man
like you isn&rsquo;t going to keep his family up on top of
this rock very long. Why, young fellow, you&rsquo;ll
have the best home in Lowville for them, where
they can live in style, in less than six months. Do
you think your mother wants to stay here after
you&rsquo;re gone. You were going away. Did you
think,&rdquo; he said shrewdly, &ldquo;what life up here would
be worth to your mother while you were away.
No, you&rsquo;re just like all boys. You wanted to get
away yourself. But you never thought what a
life this is for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, boy, she&rsquo;s a young woman yet. You
can take her out and give her a chance to live.
Do you hear, a chance to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting thought, harder and faster than
he had ever tried to think in his life. But he could
make nothing of it.</p>
<p>He thought of the people, old and young, on
the hills, suddenly set adrift from their homes.
He thought of his mother and Uncle Cassius and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Aunt Letitia without their real home to come back
to. And he thought of money&ndash;&ndash;illimitable
money: money that could do everything.</p>
<p>He did not want to look at his mother for counsel.
The man&rsquo;s talk had gone to his head. But,
slowly, unwillingly his eyes came to his mother&rsquo;s,
and he saw in hers that steady, steadfast look
which told him to wait, wait. He caught the
meaning and spoke it brusquely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Leave the options here. I&rsquo;ll see
what we&rsquo;ll do. And I&rsquo;ll write to you next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. That would not do. The big man must
have his answer at once. He stormed at Jeffrey.
He appealed to Mrs. Whiting. He blandished
Miss Letitia. He even attacked Uncle Cassius,
but that guileless man led him off into such a discussion
of cross grafting and reforestation that he
was glad to drop him.</p>
<p>In the end, he saw that, having committed himself,
he could do no better than leave the matter
to Jeffrey, trusting that, with time for thought,
the boy could not refuse his offer.</p>
<p>So the two men, having breakfasted and rested
their horses, set out on the down trip to Lowville.</p>
<p>Late that night Jeffrey Whiting and his mother
came to a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too big for us, Jeff,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We do
not know what it means. Nobody up here can tell
us. The man was lying. But we do not know
why, or what about.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is one man that could tell us. The
White Horse Chaplain, do you remember him,
Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I do. He sent Ruth away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to give her her chance, my son. Do
not forget that. He could tell us what this means.
I don&rsquo;t care anything about his religion. Your
Uncle Catty thinks he was a ghost even that day
at Fort Fisher. I don&rsquo;t. He is the Catholic
Bishop of Alden. You&rsquo;ll go to him to-morrow.
He&rsquo;ll tell you what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Bishop Joseph Winthrop of Alden was very
much worried. For the third time he picked up
and read a telegram from the Mother Superior of
the Sacred Heart Convent at Athens, telling him
that Ruth Lansing had left the convent that morning.
But the third perusal of the message did not
give him any more light on the matter than the
two previous readings had done.</p>
<p>Why should the girl have gone away? What
could have happened? Only the other day he
had received a letter from her telling of her studies
and her progress and of every new thing that was
interesting her.</p>
<p>The Bishop thought of the lonely hill home
where he had found her &ldquo;Daddy Tom&rdquo; dying,
and where he had buried him on the hillside.
Probably the girl would go back and try to live
there. And he thought of the boy who had told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
him of his love and that he wanted to keep Ruth
there in the hills.</p>
<p>As he laid down the telegraph form, his secretary
came to the door to tell him that the boy,
Jeffrey Whiting, was in the waiting room asking
to see him and refusing even to indicate the nature
of his business to any one but the Bishop himself.</p>
<p>The Bishop was startled. He had understood
that the young man was in Albany at school.
Now he thought that he would get a very clear
light upon Ruth Lansing&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to you, sir,&rdquo; said Jeffrey when the
Bishop had given him a chair, &ldquo;because you could
tell us what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you and your&ndash;&ndash;neighbour, Ruth
Lansing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, sir. What about her?&rdquo; said
Jeffrey quickly.</p>
<p>The Bishop gave the boy one keen, searching
look, and saw his mistake. The boy knew nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the Bishop answered, as he handed
Jeffrey the open telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s she gone? Why did she go?&rdquo;
Jeffrey broke out, as he read the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were coming to tell me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, reading the Bishop&rsquo;s
meaning quickly. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t write to me, not
at all. I suppose the sisters wouldn&rsquo;t have it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
But she wrote to my mother and she didn&rsquo;t say
anything about leaving there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;She seems
to have gone away suddenly. But, I am forgetting.
You came to talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And Jeffrey went on to tell, clearly
and shortly, of the coming of Rogers and his
proposition. Though it hurt, he did not fail to
tell how he had been carried away by the man&rsquo;s
offer and his flattery. He made it plain that it
was only his mother&rsquo;s insight and caution that had
held him back from accepting the offer on the instant.</p>
<p>The Bishop, listening, was proud of the down-rightness
of the young fellow. It was good to
hear. When he had heard all he bowed in his
old-fashioned, stiff way and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother, young man, is a rare and wise
woman. You will convey to her my deepest respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what it all means,&rdquo; he went on,
in another tone. &ldquo;But I can soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang a bell, and as his secretary opened the
door the Bishop said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you see, please, if General Chandler is
in his office across the street. If he is, give him
my respects and ask him to step over here a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary bowed, but hesitated a little in the
doorway.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a young girl out there, Bishop. She
says she must see you, but she will not give a name.
She seems to be in trouble, or frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting was on his feet and making for
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down where you were, young man,&rdquo; said
the Bishop sharply. If Ruth Lansing were out
there&ndash;&ndash;and the Bishop half believed that she was&ndash;&ndash;well,
it <i>might</i> be coincidence. But it was too
much for the Bishop&rsquo;s credulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send the girl in here,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing walked into the room and went
straight to the Bishop. She did not see Jeffrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came straight here all the way,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;to tell you, Bishop, that I couldn&rsquo;t stay in the
convent any longer. I am going home. I could
not stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, Ruth,&rdquo; said the
Bishop easily, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll just turn around, I
think you&rsquo;ll see some one who is even more
pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her startled cry of surprise and pleasure at
sight of Jeffrey was abundant proof to the Bishop
that the coming of these two to his door was indeed
a coincidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Bishop quickly, &ldquo;you will
both sit down and listen. It concerns both of you
deeply. A man is coming here in a moment, General
Chandler. You have both heard of him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
He is the political power of this part of the State.
He can, if he will, tell us just how serious your situation
is up there, Jeffrey. Say nothing. Just
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth looked from one to the other with surprise
and perhaps a little resentment. For hours
she had been bracing her courage for this ordeal
of meeting the Bishop, and here she was merely
told to sit down and listen to something, she did
not know what.</p>
<p>The Bishop rose as General Oliver Chandler
was ushered into the room and the two veterans
saluted each other with the stiffest of military precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are two young friends of mine from
the hills, General,&rdquo; said the Bishop, as he seated
his old friend. &ldquo;They both own farms in the
Beaver Run country. They have come to me to
find out what the U. &amp; M. Railroad wants with
options on all that country. Can you, will you
tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General plucked for a moment at the empty
left sleeve of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bishop,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I cannot give
out what I know of that matter. The interests
behind it are too large for me. I would not dare.
I do not often have to say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Bishop slowly, &ldquo;I never heard
you say that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can do this, Bishop,&rdquo; said the General,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
rising. &ldquo;If you will come over here to the end
of the room, I can tell you, privately, what I know.
You can then use your own prudence to judge
how much you can tell these young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop followed to the window at the other
end of the room, where the two men stood and
talked in undertones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey,&rdquo; said Ruth through teeth that gritted
with impatience, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t tell me this instant
what it&rsquo;s all about, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll <i>bite</i> you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey laughed softly. It took just that little
wild outbreak of hers to convince him that the
young lady who had swept into the room and faced
the Bishop was really his little playmate, his Ruth,
after all.</p>
<p>In quick whispers, he told her all he knew.</p>
<p>The Bishop walked to the door with the General,
thanking him. From the door the General
saluted gravely and stalked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer,&rdquo; said the Bishop quietly, as he
came back to them, &ldquo;is one word&ndash;&ndash;Iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Ruth, it seemed that these men were making
a mysterious fuss about nothing. But Jeffrey saw
the whole matter instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows how much there is, or how little
there is,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;The man lied to you,
Jeffrey. The road has no eminent domain. But
they can get it if they get the options on a large
part of the farms. Then, when they have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
right of eminent domain, they will let the options
lapse and buy the properties at their own prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start back to warn the people to-night,&rdquo;
said Jeffrey, jumping up. &ldquo;Maybe they made
that offer to other people besides me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;there is more to
think of. The railroad, if you serve it well, will,
no doubt, buy your farm for much more than it is
worth to you. There is your mother to be considered
first. And they will, very likely, give you
a chance to make a small fortune in your commissions,
if you are faithful to them. If you go to
fight them, they will probably crush you all in the
end, and you will be left with little or nothing.
Better go slowly, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Jeffrey. &ldquo;Take their bribe!
Take their money, for fooling and cheating the
other people out of their homes! Why, before
I&rsquo;d do that, I&rsquo;d leave that farm and everything
that&rsquo;s there and go up into the big woods with
only my axe, as my grandfather did. And my
mother would follow me! You know that! My
mother would be glad to go with me, with nothing,
nothing in her hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so would I!&rdquo; said Ruth, springing to her
feet. &ldquo;I <i>would</i>! I <i>would</i>!&rdquo; she chanted defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; said the Bishop, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not going up into the big woods,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
Jeffrey,&rdquo; Ruth said demurely. &ldquo;You are going
back home to fight them. If I could help you I
would go back with you. I would not be of any
use. So, I&rsquo;m going back, to the convent, to face
my fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, but,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, &ldquo;I thought you were
running away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I was,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Last night I
heard the voice of something calling to me. It
was such a big thing,&rdquo; she went on, turning to the
Bishop; &ldquo;it seemed such a pitiless, strong thing
that I thought it would crush me. It would take
my life and make me do what <i>it</i> wanted, not what
I wanted. I was afraid of it. I ran away. It
was like a Choir Unseen singing to me to follow,
and I didn&rsquo;t dare follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I heard it again, just now when Jeffrey
spoke that way. Now I know what it was. It
was the call of life to everybody to face life, to
take our souls in our hands and go forward. I
thought I could turn back. I can&rsquo;t. God, or
life won&rsquo;t let us turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, child. Fear nothing,&rdquo;
said the Bishop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came away,
to have it out with yourself. And you will be
very glad now to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you, young man,&rdquo; he turned to
Jeffrey, &ldquo;I should say that your mother <i>would</i> be
proud to go anywhere, empty-handed with you.
Remember that, when you are in the worst of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
fight that is before you. When you are tempted,
as you will be tempted, remember it. When you
are hard pressed, as you will be hard pressed,
<i>remember it</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>GLOW OF DAWN</h3>
</div>
<p>Twinkle-tail was gliding up Beaver Run to
his breakfast. It was past the middle of June, or,
as Twinkle-tail understood the matter, it was the
time when the snow water and the water from the
spring rains had already gone down to the Big
River: Beaver Run was still a fresh, rushing
stream of water, but it was falling fast. Soon
there would not be enough water in it to make it
safe for a trout as large as he. Then he would
have to stay down in the low, deep pond of Beaver
River, where the saw-dust came to bother him.</p>
<p>He was going up to lie all the morning in the
shallow little pond at the very head of Beaver
Run, where the hot, sweet sun beat down and drew
the flies to the surface of the pond. He was very
fond of flies and the pond was his own. He had
made it his own now through four seasons, by his
speed and his strong teeth. Even the big, greedy,
quarrelsome pike that bullied the river down below
did not dispute with him this sweet upper stretch
of his own stream. No large fish ever came up
this way now, and he did not bother with the little
ones. He liked flies better.</p>
<p>His pond lay all clean and silvery and a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
cool yet, for the sun was not high enough to have
heated it through: a beautiful breakfast room at
the bottom of the great bowl of green banks that
ran away up on every side to the rim of the high
hills.</p>
<p>Twinkle-tail was rather early for breakfast.
The sun had not yet begun to draw the flies from
their hiding places to buzz over the surface of
the water. As he shot into the centre of the pool
only one fly was in sight. A rather decrepit looking
black fly was doddering about a cat-tail stalk
at the edge of the pond. One quick flirt of his
body, and Twinkle-tail slid out of the water and
took the fly in his leap. But that was no breakfast.
He would have to settle down by the cat-tails,
in the shadows, and wait for the flies to come.</p>
<p>Twinkle-tail missed something from his pond
this season. Always, in other years, two people,
a boy and a girl, had come and watched him as he
ate his breakfast. The girl had called him
Twinkle-tail the very first time they had seen him.
But Twinkle-tail had no illusions. They were not
friends to him. He loved to lie in the shadow
of the cat-tails and watch them as they crept along
the edge of the bank. But he knew they came to
catch him. When they were there the most
tempting flies seemed to appear. Some of those
flies fell into the water, others just skimmed the
surface in the most aggravating and challenging
manner. But Twinkle-tail had always stayed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
the cat-tails and watched, and if the boy and girl
came to his side of the pond, then a lightning
twinkle of his tail was all that told them that he
had scooted out of the pool and down into the
stream. Once the girl had trailed a piece of
flashing red flannel across the water, and Twinkle-tail
could not resist. He leaped for it. A terrible
hook caught him in the side of the mouth!
In his fury and terror he dove and fought until he
broke the hook. He had never forgotten that
lesson.</p>
<p>But he was forgetting a little this season. No
one came to his pool. He was growing big and
fat, and a little careless.</p>
<p>As he lay there in the warming sand by the
cat-tails, the biggest, juiciest green bottle fly that
Twinkle-tail had ever seen came skimming down
to the very line of the water. It circled once.
Twinkle-tail did not move. It circled twice, not
an inch from the water!</p>
<p>A single, sinuous flash of his whole body, and
Twinkle-tail was out of the water! He had the
fly in his mouth.</p>
<p>Then the struggle began.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing sprang up, pole in hand, from the
shoulder of the bank behind which she had been
hiding.</p>
<p>The trout dove and started for the stream, the
line ripping through the water like a shot.</p>
<p>The girl ran, leaping from rock to rock, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
strong, slender, boy-like body giving and swaying
cunningly to every tug of the fish.</p>
<p>He turned and shot swiftly back into the pool,
throwing her off her balance and down into the
water. She rose wet and angry, clinging grimly
to the pole, and splashed her way to the other side
of the pond. She did not dare to stand and pull
against him, for fear of breaking the hook. She
could only race around, giving him all the line she
could until he should tire a little.</p>
<p>Three times they fought around the circle of the
pool, the taut line singing like a wire in the wind.
Ruth&rsquo;s hand was cut where she had fallen on the
rocks. She was splashed and muddy from head
to foot. Her breath came in great, gulping sobs.
But she fought on.</p>
<p>Twice he dragged her a hundred yards down
the Run, but she headed him back each time to the
pond where she could handle him better. She
had never before fought so big a fish all alone.
Jeffrey or Daddy Tom had always been with her.
Now she found herself calling desperately under
her breath to Jeffrey to come to help her. She
bit back the words and took a new hold on the
pole.</p>
<p>The trout was running blindly now from side
to side of the pond. He had lost his cunning.
He would soon weaken. But Ruth knew that her
strength was nearly gone too. She must use her
head quickly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>She gathered herself on the bank for one desperate
effort. She must catch him as he ran
toward her and try to flick him out of the water.
It was her only chance. She might break the line
or the pole and lose him entirely, but she would
try it.</p>
<p>Twinkle-tail came shooting through the water,
directly at her. She suddenly threw her strength
on the pole. It bent nearly double but it held.
And the fish, adding his own blind rush to her
strength, was whipped clear out on to the grass.
Dropping the pole, she dove desperately at him
where he fought on the very edge of the bank.
Finally she caught the line a few inches above his
mouth, and her prize was secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Twinkle-tail,&rdquo; she panted, as she held
him up for a good look, &ldquo;sure enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She carried him back to a large stone and
despatched him painlessly with a blunt stick.
Then she sat down to rest, for she was weak and
dizzy from her struggle.</p>
<p>Looking down at Twinkle-tail where he lay, she
said aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Jeffrey was here. He&rsquo;ll never believe
it was you unless he sees you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him all right,&rdquo; said a voice behind
her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know him in a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang up and faced Jeffrey Whiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where did you come from? Your mother
told me you wouldn&rsquo;t be back till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can go back again and stay till to-morrow
if you want me to,&rdquo; said Jeffrey,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jeff, you know I&rsquo;m glad to see you. I
was awfully disappointed when I got home and
found that you were away up in the hills. How
is your fight going on? And look at Twinkle-tail,&rdquo;
she hurried on a little nervously, for Jeffrey
had her hand and was drawing her determinedly
to him. She reached for the trout and held him
up strategically between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Fish</i>!&rdquo; said Jeffrey discontentedly as he
saw himself beaten by her ruse.</p>
<p>The girl laughed provokingly up into his sullenly
handsome face. Then she seemed to relent,
and with a friendly little tug at his arm led
him over to the edge of the pool and made him sit
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;all about
your battle with the railroad people. Your
mother told me some things, but I want it all,
from yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jeffrey was still unappeased. He looked
at her dress and shoes and said with a show of
meanness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth, you didn&rsquo;t catch Twinkle-tail fair, on
your line. You just walked into the pond and got
him in a corner and kicked him to death brutally.
I know you did. You&rsquo;re always cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth laughed, and showed him the jagged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
cut in her hand where she had fallen on the
rocks.</p>
<p>Instantly he was all interest and contrition.
He must wash the hand and dress it! But she
made him sit where he was, while she knelt down
by the water and bathed the smarting hand and
bound it with her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, when he saw that there was
nothing to be gained by delay, &ldquo;the very night that
the Bishop of Alden told me that they had found
iron in the hills here and that they were going to
try to push us all out of our homes, I started out
to warn the people. I found I wasn&rsquo;t the only
man that the railroad had tried to buy. They had
Rafe Gadbeau, you know he&rsquo;s a kind of a political
boss of the French around French Village; and a
man named Sayres over on Forked Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gadbeau had no farm of his own to sell, but
he&rsquo;d been spending money around free, and I knew
the railroad must have given it to him outright.
I told him what I had found out, about the iron
and what the land would be worth if the farmers
held on to it. But I might as well have held my
breath. He didn&rsquo;t care anything about the interests
of the people that had land. He was getting
paid well for every option that he could get. And
he was going to get all he could. I will have
trouble with that man yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other man, Sayres, is a big land-owner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
and a good man. They had fooled him, just as
that man Rogers I told you about fooled me. He
had started out in good faith to help the railroad
get the properties over on that side of the mountains,
thinking it was the best thing for the people
to do to sell out at once. When I told him about
their finding iron, he saw that they had made a
catspaw of him; and he was the maddest man you
ever saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a big man over that way, and his word
was worth ten of mine. He went right out with
me to warn every man who had a piece of land
not to sign anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks ago Rogers, who is handling
the whole business for the railroad, came up here
and had me arrested on charges of extortion and
conspiring to intimidate the land-owners. They
took me down to Lowville, but Judge Clemmons
couldn&rsquo;t find anything in the charges. So I was let
go. But they are not through. They will find
some way to get me away from here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it stand now?&rdquo; said Ruth thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Have they actually started to build the
railroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. You know they have the right of
way to run the road through. But they wouldn&rsquo;t
build it, at least not for years yet, only that they
want to get this iron property opened up. Why,
the road is to run from Welden to French Village
and there is not a single town on the whole line!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
The road wouldn&rsquo;t have business enough to keep
the rust off. They&rsquo;re building the road just the
same, so that shows that they intend to get our
property some way, no matter what we do. And
I suppose they will, somehow,&rdquo; he added sullenly.
&ldquo;They always do, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the people,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you get
them all to join and agree to sell at a fair price?
Wouldn&rsquo;t that be all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to buy. They won&rsquo;t buy
at any fair price. They only want to get options
enough to show the Legislature and the Governor,
and then they will be granted eminent domain and
they can have the land condemned and can buy it
at the price of wild land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I remember now. That&rsquo;s what the
Bishop said. Isn&rsquo;t it strange,&rdquo; she went on
slowly, &ldquo;how he seems to come into everything
we do. How he saved my Daddy Tom&rsquo;s life that
time at Fort Fisher. And how he came here that
night when Daddy was hurt. And how he picked
us up and turned us around and sent me off to
convent. And now how he seems to come into all
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody calls him the Shepherd of the
North,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I wonder if he comes
into the lives of <i>all</i> the people that way. At the
convent everybody seems to think of him as belonging
to them personally. I resented it at first,
because I thought I had more reason to know him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
than anybody. But I found that everybody felt
the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just like the Catholic Church,&rdquo; said
Jeffrey suddenly, and a little sharply; &ldquo;he comes
into everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jeffrey,&rdquo; said Ruth in surprise, &ldquo;what
do you know about the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read some.
And I&rsquo;ve had to deal a lot with the French people
up toward French Village. And I&rsquo;ve talked with
their priest up there. You know you have to talk
to the priest before it&rsquo;s any use talking to them.
That&rsquo;s the way with the Catholic Church. It
comes into everything. I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat looking across the pool for a moment,
while Ruth quietly studied the stubborn, settling
lines of his face. She saw that a few months had
made a big change in the boy and playmate that
she had known. He was no longer the bright-faced,
clear-eyed boy. His face was turning into
a man&rsquo;s face. Sharp, jagged lines of temper and
of harshness were coming into it. It showed
strength and doggedness and will, along with some
of the dour grimness of his fathers. She did not
dislike the change altogether. But it began to
make her a little timid. She was quick to see from
it that there would be certain limits beyond which
she could not play with this new man that she
found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right to be religious,&rdquo; he went on argumentatively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s religious. And Aunt
Letty&rsquo;s just full of it. But it don&rsquo;t interfere with
their lives. It&rsquo;s all right to have a preacher for
marrying or dying or something like that; and to
go to hear him if you want to. But the Catholic
Church comes right in to where those people live.
It tells them what to do and what to think about
everything. They don&rsquo;t dare speak without looking
back to it to find out what they must say. I
don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jeffrey, I&rsquo;m a Catholic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>knew</i> it!&rdquo; he said stubbornly. &ldquo;I knew it!
I knew there was something that had changed you.
And I might have known it was that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; said the girl, breaking in
quickly. &ldquo;When you came I was just wondering
to myself why it had not seemed to change me at
all. I think I was half disappointed with myself,
to think that I had gone through a wonderful
experience and it had left me just the same as I
was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it has changed you,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s going to change you a lot more. I can see it.
Please, Ruth,&rdquo; he said, suddenly softening, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t let it change you? You won&rsquo;t let it make
any difference, with us, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked soberly and steadily up into his
face, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jeffrey. It won&rsquo;t make any difference
with us, in the way you mean.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So long as we are what we are,&rdquo; she said again
after a pause, &ldquo;we will be just the same to each
other. If it should make something different out
of me than what I am, then, of course, I would
not be the same to you. Or if you should change
into something else, then you would not be the
same to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon,&rdquo; she continued decisively.
&ldquo;Nothing is clear to me, yet. I&rsquo;ve just entered
into a great, wonderful world of thought and feeling
that I never knew existed. Where it leads
to, I do not know. When I do know, Jeffrey
dear, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up sharply at her as she rose to her
feet, and he understood that she had said the last
word that was to be said. He saw something in
her face with which he did not dare to argue.</p>
<p>He got up saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to be gone. I&rsquo;m glad I found you here
at the old place. I&rsquo;ll be back to-night to help you
eat the trout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork. There&rsquo;s a couple of
men over there that are shaky. I&rsquo;ve had to keep
after them or they&rsquo;d be listening to Rafe Gadbeau
and letting their land go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ruth exclaimed, &ldquo;now when they
know, can&rsquo;t they see what is to their own interest!
Are they blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Jeffrey dully. &ldquo;But you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
how it is with those people. Their land is hard
to work. It is poor land. They have to scratch
and scrape for a little money. They don&rsquo;t see
many dollars together from one year&rsquo;s end to the
other. Even a little money, ready, green money,
shaken in their faces looks awful big to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, then, Jeff,&rdquo; she said cheerily;
&ldquo;and get back early if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said easily as he picked up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, say, Ruth.&rdquo; He turned back quietly to
her. &ldquo;If&ndash;&ndash;if I shouldn&rsquo;t be back to-night, or to-morrow;
why, watch Rafe Gadbeau. Will you?
I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to mother. And Uncle
Catty, well, he&rsquo;s not very sharp sometimes. Will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. But be careful, Jeff,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; he sang back, as he walked quickly
around the edge of the pond and slipped into the
alder bushes through which ran the trail that went
up over the ridge to the Wilbur Fork country on
the other side.</p>
<p>Ruth stood watching him as he pushed sturdily
up the opposite slope, his grey felt hat and wide
shoulders showing above the undergrowth.</p>
<p>This boy was a different being from the Jeffrey
that she had left when she went down to the convent
five months before. She could see it in his
walk, in the way he shouldered the bushes aside
just as she had seen it in his face and his talk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
He was fighting with a power that he had found
to be stronger and bigger than himself. He was
not discouraged. He had no thought of giving
up. But the airy edge of his boyish confidence
in himself was gone. He had become grim and
thoughtful and determined. He had settled
down to a long, dogged struggle.</p>
<p>He had asked her to watch Rafe Gadbeau.
How much did he mean? Why should he have
said this to her? Would it not have been better
to have warned some of the men that were associated
with him in his fight? And what was
there to be feared? She laughed at the idea of
physical fear in connection with Jeffrey. Why,
nothing ever happened in the hills, anyway.
Crimes of violence were never heard of. It was
true, the lumber jacks were rough when they came
down with the log drives in the spring. But they
only fought among themselves. And they did not
stop in the hills. They hurried on down to the
towns where they could spend their money.</p>
<p>What had Jeffrey to fear?</p>
<p>Yet, he must have meant a good deal. He
would not have spoken to her unless he had good
reason to think that something might happen to
him.</p>
<p>Withal, Ruth was not deceived. She knew the
temper of the hills. The men were easy-going.
They were slow of speech. They were generally
ruled by their more energetic women. But they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
or their fathers had all been fighting men, like her
own father. And they were rooted in the soil of
the hills. Any man or any power that attempted
to drive them from the land which their hands had
cleared and made into homes, where the bones of
their fathers and mothers lay, would have to
reckon with them as bitter, stubborn fighting men.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting was just coming to the bare top
of the ridge. In another moment he would drop
down the other side out of sight. She wondered
whether he would turn and wave to her; or had he
forgotten that she would surely be standing where
he had left her?</p>
<p>He had not forgotten. He turned and waved
briskly to her. Then he stepped down quickly
out of sight. His act was brusque and businesslike.
It showed that he remembered. He could
hardly have seen her standing there in all the
green by the pond. He had just known that she
was there. But it showed something else, too.
He had plunged down over the edge of the hill
upon a business with which his mind was filled, to
the exclusion, almost, of her and of everything
else.</p>
<p>The girl did not feel any of the little pique or
resentment that might have been very natural.
It was so that she would wish him to go about the
business that was going to be so serious for all of
them. But it gave her a new and startling flash
of insight into what was coming.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>She had always thought of her hills as the place
where peace lived. Out in the great crowded
market places of the world she knew men fought
each other for money. But why do that in the
hills? There was a little for all. And a man
could only get as much as his own labour and good
judgment would make for him out of the land.</p>
<p>Now she saw that it was not a matter of hills
or of cities. Wherever, in the hills or the city or
in the farthest desert, there was wealth or the hope
of wealth, there greedy men with power would
surely come to look for it and take it. That was
why men fought. Wealth, even the scent of
wealth whetted their appetites and drew them on
to battle.</p>
<p>A cloud passed between her and the morning
sun. She felt the premonition of tragedy and suffering
lowering down like a storm on her hills.
How foolishly she had thought that all life and all
the great, seething business of life was to be done
down in the towns and the cities. Here was life
now, with its pressure and its ugly passions, pushing
right into the very hills.</p>
<p>She shivered as she picked up her prize of the
morning and her fishing tackle and started slowly
up the hill toward her home.</p>
<p>Her farm had been rented to Norman Apgarth
with the understanding that Ruth was to spend the
summer there in her own home. The rent was
enough to give Ruth what little money she needed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
for clothes and to pay her modest expenses at the
convent at Athens. So her life was arranged for
her at least up to the time when she should have
finished school.</p>
<p>It seemed very strange to come home and find
her home in the hands of strangers. It was odd
to be a sort of guest in the house that she had
ruled and managed from almost the time that she
was a baby. It would be very hard to keep from
telling Mrs. Apgarth where things belonged and
how other things should be done. It would be
hard to stand by and see others driving the horses
that had never known a hand but hers and Daddy
Tom&rsquo;s. Still she had been very glad to come
home. It was her place. It held all the memories
and all the things that connected her with
her own people. She wanted to be able always
to come back to it and call it her own. Looking
down over it from the crest of the hill, at the little
clump of trees under which lay her Daddy Tom
and her mother, at the little house that had seen
their love and in which she had been born, she
could understand the fierceness with which men
would fight to hold the farms and homes which
were threatened.</p>
<p>Until now she had hardly realised that those
men whom people vaguely called &ldquo;the railroad&rdquo;
would want to take <i>her</i> home and farm away from
her. Now it came suddenly home to her and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
felt a swelling rage of indignation rising in her
throat. She hurried down the hill to the house,
as though she saw it already threatened.</p>
<p>She deftly threw her fishpole up on to the roof
of the wood shed and went around to the front of
the house. There she found Mrs. Apgarth weeding
in what had been Ruth&rsquo;s own flower beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a how-dye-do you did give us, Miss
Ruth!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed at sight of her.
&ldquo;I called you <i>three</i> times, and when you didn&rsquo;t
answer I went to your door; and there you were
gone! I told Norman Apgarth somebody must
have took you off in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;No danger. I&rsquo;m
used to getting up early, you see. So I just took
some cakes&ndash;&ndash;Didn&rsquo;t you miss them?&ndash;&ndash;and
some milk and slipped out without waking any one.
I wanted to catch this fish. Jeffrey Whiting and I
tried to catch him for four years. And I had to
do it myself this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So young Whiting&rsquo;s gone away, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Ruth quickly. &ldquo;He went
over to Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork about half an hour ago.
Who said he&rsquo;d gone away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody,&rdquo; said the woman hastily; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
only what they was sayin&rsquo; up at French Village
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were they saying?&rdquo; Ruth demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just talk, I suppose,&rdquo; Mrs. Apgarth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
evaded. &ldquo;Still, I dunno&rsquo;s I blame him. I guess
if I got as much money as they say he&rsquo;s got out of
it, I&rsquo;d skedaddle, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth stepped over and caught the woman
sharply by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say? Tell me, please.
Mrs. Apgarth saw that the girl was trembling
with excitement and anxiety. She saw that she
herself had said too much, or too little. She
could not stop at that. She must tell everything
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;they say he&rsquo;s just fooled
the people up over their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Ruth impatiently. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been agoin&rsquo; round holdin&rsquo; the people
back and gettin&rsquo; them to swear that they won&rsquo;t
sign a paper or sell a bit of land to the railroad.
Now it turns out he was just keepin&rsquo; the rest of
the people back till he could get a good big lot of
money from the railroad for his own farm and
for this one of yours. Oh, yes, they say he&rsquo;s sold
this farm and his own and five other ones that he&rsquo;d
got hold of, for four times what they&rsquo;re worth.
And that gives the railroad enough to work on,
so the rest of the people&rsquo;ll just have to sell for
what they can get. He&rsquo;s gone now; skipped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has <i>not</i> gone!&rdquo; Ruth snapped out indignantly.
&ldquo;I saw him only half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, of course,&rdquo; said the woman knowingly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d know more about it than anybody
else. It&rsquo;s all talk, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth blushed and dropped the fish forgotten
on the grass. She said shortly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to spend the day with Mrs. Whiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, don&rsquo;t say a word to her about this.
She&rsquo;s an awful good neighbour. I wouldn&rsquo;t for
the world have her think that I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all,&rdquo; said Ruth, as
she turned toward the road. &ldquo;You only said
what people were saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t for anything,&rdquo; the woman
called nervously after her, &ldquo;have her think that&ndash;&ndash; And
what&rsquo;ll I do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat it,&rdquo; said Ruth over her shoulder. The
prize for which she had fought so desperately in
the early morning meant nothing to her now.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting did not come home that night.
Through the long twilight of one of the longest
days of the year, Ruth sat reading in the old place
on the hill, where Jeffrey would be sure to find
her. Suddenly, when it was full dark, she knew
that he would not come.</p>
<p>She did not try to argue with herself. She did
not fight back the nervous feeling that something
had happened. She was sure that she had been
all day expecting it. When the moon came up
over the hill and the long purple shadows of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
elm trees on the crest came stalking down in the
white light, she went miserably into the house and
up to the little room they had fitted up for her in
the loft of her own home.</p>
<p>She cried herself into a wearied, troubled sleep.
But with the elasticity of youth and health she was
awake at the first hint of morning, and the cloud
of the night had passed.</p>
<p>She dressed and hurried down into the yard
where Norman Apgarth was just stirring about
with his milk pails. She was glad to face daylight
and action. A man had put his trust in her before
all others. She was eager to answer to his
faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Brom Bones?&rdquo; she demanded of the
still drowsy Apgarth as she caught him crossing
the yard from the milk house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colt? He&rsquo;s up in the back pasture, just
around the knob of the mountain. What was you
calc&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to do with him, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to use him,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use him? Certainly, if you want to. But,
say, Miss, that colt ain&rsquo;t been driv&rsquo; since the
Spring&rsquo;s work. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s so fat an&rsquo; silky he&rsquo;s liable
to act foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to <i>ride</i> him,&rdquo; said Ruth briefly, as
she stepped to the horse barn door for a bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, say, Miss,&rdquo; the man opposed feebly,
&ldquo;you could take the brown pony just as well; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
don&rsquo;t need her a bit. And I tell you that colt is
just a lun-<i>at</i>-ic, when he&rsquo;s been idle so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth, as she started up the
hill. &ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;ll find work enough to satisfy
even Brom Bones to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big black colt followed her peaceably down
the mountain, and stood champing at the door
while she went in to get something to eat. When
she brought out a shining new side saddle he
looked suspiciously at the strange thing, but he
made no serious objection as she fastened it on.
Ruth herself, when she had buckled it tight, stood
looking doubtfully at it. A side saddle was as
new to her as it was to the horse. She had bought
it on her way home the other day, as a concession
to the fact that she was now a young lady who
could no longer go stampeding over the hills on a
bare-backed horse.</p>
<p>She mounted easily, but Brom Bones, seeming
to know in the way of his kind that she was uneasy
and uncomfortable, began at once to act badly.
His intention seemed to be to walk into the open
well on his hind feet. The girl caught a short
hold on her lines and cut him sharply across the
ear. He wheeled on two feet and bolted for the
hill, clearing the woodshed by mere inches.</p>
<p>The path led straight up to the top of the slope.
Ruth did not try to hold him. The sooner he ran
the conceit out of himself, she thought, the better.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>He hurled himself down the other slope, past
the pool, and into the trail which Jeffrey had taken
yesterday. It was break-neck riding, in a strange
saddle. But the girl&rsquo;s anxiety rose with the excitement
of the horse&rsquo;s wild rush, so that when
they reached the top of the divide where she had
last seen Jeffrey it was the horse and not the girl
that was ready to settle down to a sober and safer
pace.</p>
<p>Her common sense told her that she was probably
foolish; that Jeffrey had merely stayed over
night somewhere and that she would meet him on
the way. But another and a subtler sense kept
whispering to her to hurry on, that she was
needed, that the good name, if not the life, of the
boy she loved was in danger!</p>
<p>She had found out from Mrs. Whiting just
who were the men whom Jeffrey had gone to see.
But she did not know how she could dash up to
their doors and demand to know where he was.
It was eleven miles up the stony trail that followed
Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork, and the girl&rsquo;s nerves now keyed
up to expect she knew not what jangled at every
turn of the road. Jeffrey had meant to come
straight back this way to her. That he had not
done so meant that <i>something</i> had stopped him on
the way. What was it?</p>
<p>On one side the trail was flanked by giant hemlocks
and the underbrush was grown into an impenetrable
wall. On the other it ran sheer along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
the edge of Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork, a rock-bottomed, rushing
stream that tumbled and brawled its way down
the long slope of the country.</p>
<p>Time after time the girl shuddered and gripped
her saddle as she pushed on past a place where the
undergrowth came right down to the trail, and
six feet away the path dropped off thirty feet to
the rock bed of the stream. She caught herself
leaning across the saddle to look down. A man
might have stood in the brush as Jeffrey came
carelessly along. And that man might have
swung a cant-stick once&ndash;&ndash;a single blow at the
back of the head&ndash;&ndash;and Jeffrey would have gone
stumbling and falling over the edge of the path.
There would not be even the sign of a struggle.</p>
<p>Once she stopped and took hold of her nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth Lansing,&rdquo; she scolded aloud, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
making a little fool of yourself. You&rsquo;ve been
down there in that convent living among a lot of
girls, and you&rsquo;re forgetting that these hills are
your own, that there never was and never is any
danger in them for us who belong here. Just
keep that in your mind and hustle on about your
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she came out into the open country near
the head of the Fork she met old Darius Wilbur
turning his cattle to pasture. The old man
did not know the girl, but he knew the Lansing
colt and he looked sharply at the steaming withers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
of Brom Bones before he would give any attention
to her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the tarnation hurry, young lady?&rdquo; he
inquired exasperatingly. &ldquo;Jeff Whiting? Yes,
he was here yest&rsquo;day. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he start home by this trail?&rdquo; asked Ruth
eagerly. &ldquo;Or did he go on up country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went on up country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth headed Brom Bones up the trail again
without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stay!&rdquo; the old man yelled after her,
when she had gone twenty yards. &ldquo;He came
back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth pulled around so sharply that she nearly
threw Brom Bones to his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ask me that,&rdquo; the old man chortled, as
she came back, &ldquo;but if I didn&rsquo;t tell you I reckon
you&rsquo;d run that colt to death up the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he <i>did</i> take the Forks trail back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t do that, nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where <i>did</i> he go? Please tell me!&rdquo;
cried the girl, the tears of vexation rising into her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, girl? He crossed
the Fork just there,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing,
&ldquo;and he took over the hill for French Village.
You his wife? You&rsquo;re mighty young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ruth did not hear. She and Brom Bones
were already slipping down the rough bank in a
shower of dirt and stones.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>In the middle of the ford she stopped and
loosened the bridle, let the colt drink a little, then
drove him across, up the other bank and on up the
stiff slope.</p>
<p>She did not know the trail, but she knew the
general run of the country that way and had no
doubt of finding her road.</p>
<p>Now she told herself that it was certainly a
wild goose chase. Jeffrey had merely found that
he had to see some one in French Village and had
gone there and, of course, had spent the night
there.</p>
<p>By the time she had come over the ridge of the
hill and was dropping down through the heavily
wooded country toward French Village, she had
begun to feel just a little bit foolish. But she suddenly
remembered that it was Saint John the Baptist&rsquo;s
day. It was not a holy day of obligation
but she knew it was a feast day in French Village.
There would be Mass. She should have gone,
anyway. And she would hear with her own ears
the things they were saying about Jeffrey Whiting.</p>
<p>Arsene LaComb sat on the steps of his store
in French Village in the glory of a stiff white shirt
and a festal red vest. The store was closed, of
course, in honour of the day. In a few minutes he
would put on his black coat, in his official capacity
of trustee of the church, and march solemnly over
to ring the bell for Mass.</p>
<p>The spectacle of a smartly-dressed young lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
whom he seemed to know vaguely, riding down
the dusty street on a shiny yellow side saddle on
the back of a big, vicious-looking black colt, made
the little man reach hastily for his coat of ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle Lansing!&rdquo; he said, bowing in
friendly pomp as Ruth drove up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. LaComb? I came
down to go to Mass. Can you tell me what time
it begins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall ring the bell when I have put away
your horse, M&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle.&rdquo; Now no earthly power
could have made Arsene LaComb deviate a minute
from the exact time for ringing that bell.
But, he was a Frenchman. His manner intimated
that the ringing of all bells whatsoever must await
her convenience.</p>
<p>He stepped forward jauntily to help her down.
Ruth kicked her feet loose and slid down
deftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you again, Mr. LaComb,&rdquo;
said Ruth as she took his hand. &ldquo;Did you see
Jeffrey Whiting in the Village last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A girl of about Ruth&rsquo;s own age had come
quietly up the street and stood beside them, recording
in one swift inspection every detail of
Ruth from her little riding cap to the tips of her
brown boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cynthe,&rdquo; said the little man briskly, &ldquo;you
show Miss Lansing on my pew for Mass.&rdquo; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
took the bridle from Ruth&rsquo;s hand and led the horse
away to the shed in the rear of the store.</p>
<p>The fear and uneasiness of the early morning
leaped back to Ruth. The little man had certainly
run away from her question. Why should
he not answer?</p>
<p>She would have liked to linger a while among
the people standing about the church door. She
knew some of them. She might have asked questions
of them. But her escort led her straight into
the church and up to a front pew.</p>
<p>At the end of the Mass the people filed out
quietly, but at the church door they broke into volleys
of rapid-fire French chatter of which Ruth
could only catch a little here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come by the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, M&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle. You
will not dance <i>non</i>, I s&rsquo;pose. But you will eat,
and you will see the fun they make, one <i>jolie</i> time!
Till I ring the Vesper bell they will dance.&rdquo;
Arsene led Ruth and the other girl, whom she
now learned was Hyacinthe Cardinal, across the
road to a little wood that stood opposite the
church. There were tables, on which the women
had already begun to spread the food that they had
brought from home, and a dancing platform. On
a great stump which had been carved rudely into
a chair sat Soriel Brouchard, the fiddler of the
hills, twiddling critically at his strings.</p>
<p>It seemed strange to Ruth that these people who
had a moment before been so devout and concentrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
in church should in an instant switch
their whole thought to a day of eating and merrymaking.
But she soon found their light-hearted
gaiety very infectious. Before she knew it, she
was sputtering away in the best French she had
and entering into the fun with all her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is Rafe Gadbeau?&rdquo; she suddenly
asked Cynthe Cardinal. &ldquo;I want to know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for you want to know him?&rdquo; the girl
asked sharply in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Ruth carelessly, &ldquo;only
I&rsquo;ve heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl reached out into the crowd and
plucked at the sleeve of a tall, beak-nosed man.
The man was evidently flattered by Ruth&rsquo;s request,
and wanted her to dance with him immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;I do not know how to dance
your dances, and we&rsquo;d only break up the sets if
I tried to learn now. We&rsquo;ve heard a lot about
you, Mr. Gadbeau, so, of course, I wanted to
know you. And we&rsquo;ve heard some things about
Jeffrey Whiting. I&rsquo;m sure you could tell me if
they are true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo; dance? Well, we sit then. I tell
you. One rascal, this young Whiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth bit back an angry protest, and schooled
herself to listen quietly as he led her to a seat.</p>
<p>As they left the other girl standing in the middle
of the platform, Ruth, looking back, caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
a swift glance of what she knew was jealous anger
in her eyes. Ruth was sorry. She did not want
to make an enemy of this girl. But she felt that
she must use every effort to get this man to tell
her all he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One rascal, I tell you,&rdquo; repeated Gadbeau.
&ldquo;First he stop all the people. He say don&rsquo; sell
nodding. Den he sell his own farm, him. He
sell some more; he got big price. Now he skip
the country, right out. An&rsquo; he leave these poor
French people in the soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he sat back tapping himself on the
chest&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I got hinfluence with that railroad.
They buy now from us. To-morrow morning,
nine o&rsquo;clock, here comes that railroad lawyer on
French Village. We sell out everything on the
option to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Ruth, trying to draw him out,
&ldquo;if Jeffrey Whiting should come back before
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo; come back, that fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I&ndash;&ndash; He don&rsquo; come back. I tell
you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey Whiting will be here before nine
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, turning suddenly
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? M&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle, what you mean? What
you know?&rdquo; he questioned excitedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. I see Miss Cardinal looking at
us,&rdquo; she smiled as she arose, &ldquo;and I think you are
in for a lecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through all the long day, while she ate and
listened to the fun and talked to Father Ponfret
about her convent life, she did not let Rafe Gadbeau
out of her sight or mind for an instant. She
knew that she had alarmed him. She was certain
that he knew what had happened to Jeffrey
Whiting. And she was waiting for him to betray
himself in some way.</p>
<p>When Arsene LaComb rang the bell for Vespers,
she waited by the bell ringer to see that
Gadbeau came into the church. He took his place
among the men, and then Ruth dropped quietly
into a pew near the door. When the people rose
to sing the <i>Tantum Ergo</i>, she saw Gadbeau slip
unnoticed out of the church. She waited tensely
until the singing was finished, then she almost ran
to the door.</p>
<p>Gadbeau, mounted on one of the ponies that
had been standing all day in the little woods, was
riding away in the direction of the trail which she
had come down this morning. She fairly flew
down the street to Arsene LaComb&rsquo;s store.
There was not a pony in the hills that Brom Bones
could not overtake easily, but she must see by what
trail the man left the Village.</p>
<p>Brom Bones was very willing to make a race
for home, and she let him have his head until she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
again caught sight of the man. She pulled up
sharply and forced the colt down to a walk. The
man was still on the main road, and he might turn
any moment. Finally she saw him pull into the
trail that led over to Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork. Then she
knew. Jeffrey was somewhere on the trail between
French Village and Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork. And
he was alive! The man was going now to make
sure that he was still there.</p>
<p>For an hour, the long, high twilight was enough
to assure her that the man was still following
the trail. Then, just when the real darkness had
fallen, she heard a pony whinny in the woods at
her left. The man had turned off into the woods!
She had almost passed him! She threw herself
out upon Brom Bones&rsquo; neck and caught him by
the nose. He threw up his head indignantly and
tried to bolt, but she blessed him for making no
noise. She drove on quietly a couple of hundred
yards, slipped down, and drew Brom Bones into
the bushes away from the road and tied him. She
talked to him, patting his head and neck, pleading
with him to be quiet. Then she left him and
stole back to where she had heard the pony.</p>
<p>In the gloom of the woods she could see nothing.
But her feet found themselves on what
seemed to be a path and she followed it blindly.
She almost walked into a square black thing that
suddenly confronted her. Within what seemed a
foot of her she heard voices. Her heart stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
beating, but the blood rang in her ears so that she
could not distinguish a word. One of the voices
was certainly Gadbeau&rsquo;s. The other&ndash;&ndash; It
was!&ndash;&ndash; It was! Though it was only a mumble,
she knew it was Jeffrey Whiting who tried to
speak!</p>
<p>She took a step forward, ready to dash into
the place, whatever it was. But the caution of the
hills made her back away noiselessly into the
brush. What could she do? Why? Oh, <i>why</i>
had she not brought a rifle? Gadbeau was sure to
be armed. Jeffrey was a prisoner, probably
wounded and bound.</p>
<p>She backed farther into the bushes and started
to make a circuit of the place. She understood
now that it was a sugar hut, built entirely of logs,
even the roof. It was as strong as a blockhouse.
She knew that she was helpless. And she knew
that Jeffrey would not be a prisoner there unless
he were hurt.</p>
<p>She could only wait. Gadbeau had not come
to injure Jeffrey further. He had merely come to
make himself sure that his prisoner was secure.
He would not stay long.</p>
<p>As she stole around away from the path and
the pony she saw a little stream of light shoot
out through a chink between the logs of the hut.
Gadbeau had made a light. Probably he had
brought something for Jeffrey to eat. She pulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
off the white collar of her jacket, the only white
thing that showed about her and settled down for
a long wait.</p>
<p>First she had thought that she ought to steal
away to her horse and ride for help. But she
could not bear the thought of even getting beyond
the sound of Jeffrey&rsquo;s voice. She knew
where he was now. He might be taken away
while she was gone. And, besides, Ruth Lansing
had always learned to do things for herself. She
had always disliked appealing for help.</p>
<p>Hour after hour she sat in the darkest place
she could find, leaning against the bole of a great
tree. The light, candles, of course, burned on;
and the voices came irregularly through the living
silence of the woods. She did not dare to
creep nearer to hear what was being said. That
did not matter. The important thing was to have
Gadbeau go away without any suspicion that he
had been followed. Then she would be free to
release Jeffrey. She had no fear but that she
would be able to get him down to French Village
in the morning. She could easily have him there
before nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>When she saw by the stars that it was long
past midnight she began to be worried. Just then
the light went out. Ah! The man was going
away at last! She waited a long, nervous half
hour. But there was no sound. She dared not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
move, for even when she shifted her position
against the tree the oppressive silence seemed to
crackle with her motion.</p>
<p>Would he never come out? It seemed not.
Was he going to stay there all night?</p>
<p>Noiseless as a cat, she rose and crept to the
door of the cabin. Apparently both men were
asleep within. She pushed the door ever so
quietly. It was firmly barred on the inside.</p>
<p>What could she do? Nothing, absolutely
nothing! Oh, why, <i>why</i> had she not brought a
rifle? She would shoot. She <i>would</i>, if she had
it now, and that man opened the door! It was
too late now to think of riding for help, too late!</p>
<p>She sank down again beside her tree and raged
helplessly at herself, at her conceit in herself that
would not let her go for help in the first place,
at her foolishness in coming on this business without
a gun. The hours dragged out their weary
minutes, every minute an age to the taut, ragged
nerves of the girl.</p>
<p>The dawn came stealing across the tree-tops,
while the ground still lay in utter darkness. Ruth
rose and slipped farther back into the bushes.</p>
<p>Suddenly she found herself upon her knees in
the soft grass, and the hot, angry tears of desperation
and rage at herself were softened. Her
heart was lighted up with the glow of dawn and
sang its prayer to God; a thrilling, lifting little
prayer of confidence and wonder. The words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
that the night before would not form themselves
for her now sprang up ready in her soul&ndash;&ndash;the
words of all the children of earth, to Our Father
Who Art in Heaven&ndash;&ndash;paused an instant to bless
her lips, then sped away to God in His Heaven.
Fear was gone, and doubt, and anxiety. She
would save Jeffrey, and she would save the poor,
befooled people from ruin. God had told her so,
as He walked abroad in the <i>Glow</i> of <i>Dawn</i>.</p>
<p>Two long hours more she waited, but now with
patience and a sure confidence. Then Rafe Gadbeau
came out of the hut and strode down the
path to his pony.</p>
<p>Ruth rose stiff and wet from the ground and
ran to the door, and called to Jeffrey. The only
answer was a moan. The door was locked with
a great iron clasp and staple joined by a heavy
padlock. She reached for the nearest stone and
attacked the lock frantically. She beat it out of
all semblance to a lock, but still it defied her.
There was no window in the hut. She had to
come back again to the lock. Her hands, softened
by the months in the convent, left bloody marks on
the tough brass of the lock. In the end it gave,
and she threw herself against the door.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was lying trussed, face down, on a bunk
beside the furnace where they boiled the sugar
sap. His arms were stretched out and tied together
down under the narrow bunk. She saw
that his left arm was broken. For an instant the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
girl&rsquo;s heart leaped back to the rage of the night
when she had almost prayed for her rifle. But
pity swallowed up every other feeling as she cut
the cords from his hands and loosened the rope
that they had bound in between his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk, Jeff,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;I can
see just what happened. Lie easy and get your
strength. I&rsquo;ve got to take you to French Village
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran out to bring water. When she returned
he was sitting dizzily on the edge of the bunk.
While she bathed his head with the water and
gave him a little to drink, she talked to him and
crooned over him as she would over a baby for
she saw that he was shaken and half delirious with
pain.</p>
<p>Brom Bones was standing munching twigs
where she had left him. He had never before
been asked to carry double and he did not like it.
But the girl pleaded so pitifully and so gently into
his silky black ear that he finally gave in.</p>
<p>When they were mounted, she fastened the
white collar of her jacket into a sling for the
boy&rsquo;s broken arm, and with a prayer to the heathen
Brom Bones to go tenderly they were off down
the trail.</p>
<p>When they were half way down the trail Jeffrey
spoke suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ruth, what&rsquo;s the use trying to save these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
people? Let&rsquo;s sell out while we can and take
mother and go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jeff, dear,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;this fight
hasn&rsquo;t begun yet. Wait till we get to French Village.
You&rsquo;ll say something different. You&rsquo;ll say
just what you said to the Shepherd of the North;
remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey said no more. The girl&rsquo;s heart was
weak with the pain she knew he was bearing, but
she knew that they must go through with this.</p>
<p>All French Village and the farmers of Little
Tupper country were gathered in front of Arsene
Lacomb&rsquo;s store. Rafe Gadbeau was standing on
the steps haranguing them. He had stayed with
his prisoner as he thought up to the last possible
moment, so he stammered in his speech when he
saw a big black horse come tearing down the street
carrying a girl and a white-faced, black-headed boy
behind her. Rogers, the railroad lawyer beside
him, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, man. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drove the horse right in through the
crowd until Jeffrey Whiting faced Rogers. Then
Jeffrey, gritting his teeth on his pain, took up his
fight again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogers,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you did this. You
got Rafe Gadbeau and the others to knock me on
the head and put me out of the way, so that you
could spread your lies about me. And you&rsquo;d have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
won out, too, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for this brave girl
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Rogers, you liar,&rdquo; he shouted louder,
&ldquo;I dare you, dare you, to tell these people here
that I or any of our people have sold you a foot
of land. I dare you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rogers would have argued, but Rafe Gadbeau
pulled him away. Gadbeau knew that crowd.
They were a crowd of Frenchmen, volatile and
full of potential fury. They were already cheering
the brave girl. In a few minutes they would
be hunting the life of the man who had lied to
them and nearly ruined them.</p>
<p>A hundred hands reached up to lift Ruth from
the saddle, but she waved them away and pointed
to Jeffrey&rsquo;s broken arm. They helped him down
and half carried him into Doctor Napoleon Goodenough&rsquo;s
little office.</p>
<p>Ruth saw that her business was finished. She
wheeled Brom Bones toward home, and gave him
his head.</p>
<p>For three glorious miles they fairly flew through
the pearly morning air along the hard mountain
road, and the girl never pulled a line. Breakfastless
and weary in body, her heart sang the
song that it had learned in the Glow of Dawn.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>THE ANSWER</h3>
</div>
<p>The Committee on Franchises was in session in
one of the committee rooms outside the chamber
of the New York State Senate. It was not a routine
session. A bill was before it, the purpose of
which was virtually to dispossess some four or
five hundred families of their homes in the counties
of Hamilton, Tupper and Racquette. The
bill did not say this. It cited the need of adequate
transportation in that part of the State and
proposed that the U. &amp; M. Railroad should be
granted the right of eminent domain over three
thousand square miles of the region, in order to
help the development of the country.</p>
<p>The committee was composed of five members,
three of the majority party in the Senate and two
of the minority. A political agent of the railroad
who drew a salary from Racquette County as a
judge had just finished presenting to the committee
the reasons why the people of that part of
the State were unanimous in the wish that the bill
should become a law. He had drawn a pathetic
picture of the condition of the farmers, so long
deprived of the benefits of a railroad. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
almost wept as he told of the rich loads of produce
left to rot up there in the hills because the men
who toiled to produce it had no means of bringing
it down to the starving thousands of the cities.
The scraggy rocks and thinly soiled farms of that
region became in his picture vast reservoirs of
cheap food, only waiting to be tapped by the
beneficent railroad for the benefit of the world&rsquo;s
poor.</p>
<p>When the judge had finished, one minority
member of the committee looked at his colleague,
the other minority member, and winked. It was
a grave and respectful wink. It meant that the
committee was not often privileged to listen to
quite such bare-faced effrontery. If the hearing
had been a secret one they would not have listened
to it. But the bill had already aroused a storm.
So the leader of the majority had given orders
that the hearing should be public.</p>
<p>So far not a word had been said as to the fact
which underlay the motives of the bill. Iron had
been found in workable quantities in those three
thousand square miles of hill country. Not a
word had been said about iron.</p>
<p>No one in the room had listened to the speech
with any degree of interest. It was intended entirely
for the consumption of the outside public.
Even the reporters had sat listless and bored during
its delivery. They had been furnished with
advance copies of it and had already turned them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
in to their papers. But with the naming of the
next witness a stir of interest ran sharply around
the room.</p>
<p>Bishop Joseph Winthrop of Alden rose from
his place in the rear of the room and walked
briskly forward to the chair reserved. A tall,
spare figure of a man coming to his sixty years,
his hair as white as the snow of his hills, with a
large, firm mouth and the nose of a Puritan governor,
he would have attracted attention under almost
any circumstances.</p>
<p>Nathan Gorham, the chairman of the committee,
had received his orders from the leader of the
majority in the Senate that the bill should be reported
back favourably to that body before night.
He had anticipated no difficulty. The form of a
public hearing had to be gone through with. It
was the most effective way of disarming the suspicions
that had been aroused as to the nature of
the bill. The speech of the Racquette County
Judge was the usual thing at public hearings. The
chairman had expected that one or two self-advertising
reformers of the opposition would come before
the committee with time-honoured, stock diatribes
against the rapacity and greed of railroads
in general and this one in particular. Then he
and his two majority colleagues would vote to report
the bill favourably, while the two members
of the minority would vote to report adversely.
This, the chairman said, was about all a public
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
hearing ever amounted to. He had not counted
on the coming of the Bishop of Alden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The committee would like to hear, sir,&rdquo; began
the chairman, as the Bishop took his place, &ldquo;whom
you represent in the matter of this bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporters, scenting a welcome sensation in
what had been a dull session of a dull committee,
sat with poised pencils while the Bishop turned a
look of quiet gravity upon the chairman and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I represent Joseph Winthrop, a voter of
Racquette County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, sir, of course. The committee
quite understands that you do not come here in the
interest of any one. But the gentleman who has
just been before us spoke for the farmers who
would be most directly affected by the prosperity
of the railroad, including those of your county.
Are we to understand that there is opposition in
your county to the proposed grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your committee,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;cannot be
ignorant that there is the most stubborn opposition
to this grant in all three counties. If there had
not been that opposition, there would have been no
call for the bill which you are now considering.
If the railroad could have gotten the options which
it tried to get on those farms the grant would have
been given without question. Your committee
knows this better than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; returned the chairman, &ldquo;we have been
advised that the railroad was not able to get those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
options because a boy up there in the Beaver River
country, who fancied that he had some grievance
against the railroad people, banded the people together
to oppose the options in unfair and unlawful
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chairman paused an impressive moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;from what this committee
has been able to gather, it looks very much
as though there were conspiracy in the matter,
against the U. &amp; M. Railroad. It almost would
seem that some rival of the railroad in question
had used the boy and his fancied grievance to
manufacture opposition. Conspiracy could not be
proven, but there was every appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop smiled grimly as he dropped his
challenge quietly at the feet of the committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy, Jeffrey Whiting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was
guided by me. I directed his movements from the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole room sat up and leaned forward as
one man, alive to the fact that a novel and stirring
situation was being developed. Everybody had
understood that the Bishop had come to plead the
cause of the French-Canadian farmers of the
hills.</p>
<p>They had supposed that he would speak only
on what was a side issue of the case. No one had
expected that he would attack the main question
of the bill itself. And here he was openly proclaiming
himself the principal in that silent, stubborn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
fight that had been going on up in the hills
for six months!</p>
<p>The reporters doubled down to their work and
wrote furiously. They were trying to throw this
unusual man upon a screen before their readers.
It was not easy. He was an unmistakable product
of New England, and what was more he had been
one of the leaders of that collection of striking
men who made the Brook Farm &ldquo;Experiment.&rdquo;
He had endeared himself to the old generation of
Americans by his war record as a chaplain. To
some of the new generation he was known as the
Yankee Bishop. But in the hill country, from
the Mohawk Valley to the Canadian line and to
Lake Champlain, he had one name, The Shepherd
of the North. From Old Forge to Ausable to
North Creek men knew his ways and felt the beating
of the great heart of him behind the stern,
ascetic set of his countenance.</p>
<p>As much as they could of this the reporters
were trying to put into their notes while Nathan
Gorham was recovering from his surprise. That
well-trained statesman saw that he had let himself
into a trap. He had been too zealous in announcing
his impression that the opposition to the
U. &amp; M. Railroad was the work of a jealous rival.
The Bishop had taken that ground from under
him by a simple stroke of truth. He could
neither go forward with his charge nor could he
retract it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be so kind, then, as to tell this
committee,&rdquo; he temporised, &ldquo;just why you wished
to arouse this opposition to the railroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not and has never been any opposition
whatever to the railroad,&rdquo; said the Bishop.
&ldquo;The bill before your committee has nothing to
do with the right of way of the railroad. That
has already been granted. Your bill proposes to
confiscate, practically, from the present owners a
strip of valuable land forty miles wide by nearly
eighty miles long. That land is valuable because
the experts of the railroad know, and the people
up there know, and, I think, this committee knows
that there is iron ore in these hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said that I do not represent any one
here,&rdquo; the Bishop went on. &ldquo;But there are four
hundred families up there in our hills who stand
to suffer by this bill. They are a silent people.
They have no voice to reach the world. I have
asked to speak before your committee because
only in this way can the case of my people reach
the great, final trial court of publicity before the
whole State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a silent people, the people of the
hills. You will have heard that they are a stubborn
people. They are a stubborn people, for
they cling to their rocky soil and to the hillside
homes that their hands have made just as do the
hardy trees of the hills. You cannot uproot them
by the stroke of a pen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;These people are my friends and my neighbours.
Many of them were once my comrades.
I know what they think. I know what they feel.
I would beg your committee to consider very
earnestly this question before bringing to bear
against these people the sovereign power of the
State. They love their State. Many of them
have loved their country to the peril of their
lives. They live on the little farms that their
fathers literally hewed out of a resisting wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not through prejudice or ignorance are they
opposing this development, which will in the end
be for the good of the whole region. They are
opposed to this bill before you because it would
give a corporation power to drive them from the
homes they love, and that without fair compensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are opposed to it because they are
Americans. They know what it has meant and
what it still means to be Americans. And they
know that this bill is directly against everything
that is American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are ever ready to submit themselves to
the sovereign will of the State, but you will never
convince them that this bill is the real will of the
State. They are fighting men and the sons of
fighting men. They have fought the course of the
railroad in trying to get options from them by
coercion and trickery. They have been aroused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Their homes, poor and wretched as they often
are, mean more to them than any law you can set
on paper. They will fight this law, if you pass it.
It will set a ring of fire and murder about our
peaceful hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of high justice, in the name of
common honesty, in the name&ndash;&ndash;to come to lower
levels&ndash;&ndash;of political common sense, I tell you this
bill should never go back to the Senate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wrong, it is unjust, and it can only rebound
upon those who are found weak enough to
let it pass here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop paused, and the racing, jabbing pencils
of the reporters could be plainly heard in the
hush of the room.</p>
<p>Nathan Gorham broke the pause with a hesitating
question which he had been wanting to put
from the beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the committee has been badly informed,&rdquo;
he began to the Bishop; &ldquo;we understood
that your people, sir, were mostly Canadian
immigrants and not usually owners of land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary for me to repeat,&rdquo; said the
Bishop, turning sharply, &ldquo;that I am here, Joseph
Winthrop, speaking of and for my neighbours and
my friends? Does it matter to them or to this
committee that I wear the badge of a service that
they do not understand? I do not come before
you as the Catholic bishop. Neither do I come
as an owner of property. I come because I think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
the cause of my friends will be served by my coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The facts I have laid before you, the warning
I have given might as well have been sent out
direct through the press. But I have chosen to
come before you, with your permission, because
these facts will get a wider hearing and a more
eager reading coming from this room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not seek to create sensation here. I
have no doubt that some of you are thinking that
the place for a churchman to speak is in his church.
But I am willing to face that criticism. I am willing
to create sensation. I am willing that you
should say that I have gone far beyond the privilege
of a witness invited to come before your
committee. I am willing, in fact, that you should
put any interpretation you like upon my use of my
privilege here, only so that my neighbours of the
hills shall have their matter put squarely and fully
before all the people of the State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this matter is once thoroughly understood
by the people, then I know that no branch
of the lawmaking power will dare make itself responsible
for the passage of this bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop stood a moment, waiting for further
questions. When he saw that none were
forthcoming, he thanked the committee and
begged leave to retire.</p>
<p>As the Bishop passed out of the room the
chairman arose and declared the public hearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
closed. Witnesses, spectators and reporters
crowded out of the room and scattered through
the corridors of the Capitol. Four or five reporters
bunched themselves about the elevator
shaft waiting for a car. One of them, a tow-haired
boy of twenty, summed up the matter with
irreverent brevity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it got a fine funeral, anyway,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Not every bad bill has a bishop at the obsequies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said the Associated Press
man slowly; &ldquo;they might report it out in spite
of all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said the youngster shortly. &ldquo;The
Senate wouldn&rsquo;t dare touch it once this stuff is
in the papers.&rdquo; And he jammed a wad of flimsy
down into his pocket.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Three weeks of a blistering August sun had
withered the grasses of the hills almost to a powder.
The thin soil of the north country, where
the trees have been cut away, does not hold moisture;
so that the heat of the short, vicious summer
goes down through the roots of the vegetation to
the rock beneath and heats it as a cooking stone.</p>
<p>Since June there had been no rain. The
tumbling hill streams were reduced to a trickle
among the rocks of their beds. The uplands were
covered with a mat of baked, dead grass. The
second growth of stunted timber, showing everywhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
the scars of the wasting rapacity of man,
stood stark and wilted to the roots. All roving
life, from the cattle to the woodchucks and even
the field mice, had moved down to hide itself in
the thicker growths near the water courses or had
stolen away into the depths of the thick woods.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing reined Brom Bones in under a
scarred pine on the French Village road and sat
looking soberly at the slopes that stretched up
away from the road on either side. Every child
of the hills knew the menace that a hot dry summer
brought to us in those days. The first, ruthless
cutting of the timber had followed the water
courses. Men had cut and slashed their way up
through the hills without thought of what they
were leaving behind. They had taken only the
prime, sound trees that stood handiest to the roll-ways.
They had left dead and dying trees standing.
Everywhere they had strewn loose heaps of
brush and trimmings. The farmers had come
pushing into the hills in the wake of the lumbermen
and had cleared their pieces for corn and potatoes
and hay land. But around every piece of
cleared land there was an ever-encroaching ring of
brush and undergrowth and fallen timber that held
a constant threat for the little home within the
ring.</p>
<p>A summer without rain meant a season of grim
and unrelenting watchfulness. Men armed themselves
and tramped through the woods on unbidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
sentry duty, to see that no campfires were
made. Strangers and outsiders who were likely
to be careless were watched from the moment they
came into the hills until they were seen safely out
of them again. Where other children scouted for
and fought imaginary Indians, the children of our
hills hunted and fought imaginary fires. The
forest fire was to them not a tradition or a bugaboo.
It was an enemy that lurked just outside the
little clearing of the farm, out there in the underbrush
and fallen timber.</p>
<p>Ruth was waiting for Jeffrey Whiting. He had
ridden up to French Village for mail. For some
weeks they had known that the railroad would try
to have its bill for eminent domain passed at the
special session of the Legislature. And they
knew that the session would probably come to a
close this week.</p>
<p>If that bill became a law, then the resistance of
the people of the hills had been in vain: Jeffrey
had merely led them into a bitter and useless fight
against a power with which they could not cope.
They would have to leave their homes, taking
whatever a corrupted board of condemnation
would grant for them. It would be hard on all,
but it would fall upon Jeffrey with a crushing bitterness.
He would have to remember that he had
had the chance to make his mother and himself
independently rich. He had thrown away that
chance, and now if his fight had failed he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
have nothing to bring back to his mother but his
own miserable failure.</p>
<p>Ruth remembered that day in the Bishop&rsquo;s house
in Alden when Jeffrey had said proudly that his
mother would be glad to follow him into poverty.
And she smiled now at her own outburst at that
time. They had both meant it, every word; but
the ashes of failure are bitter. And she had seen
the iron of this fight biting into Jeffrey through
all the summer.</p>
<p>She, too, would lose a great deal if the railroad
had succeeded. She would not be able to go back
to school, and would probably have to go somewhere
to get work of some kind, for the little that
she would get for her farm now would not keep
her any time. But that was a little matter, or at
least it seemed little and vague beside the imminence
of Jeffrey&rsquo;s failure and what he would
consider his disgrace. She did not know how he
would take it, for during the summer she had seen
him in vicious moods when he seemed capable of
everything.</p>
<p>She saw the speck which he made against the
horizon as he came over Argyle Mountain three
miles away and she saw that he was riding fast.
He was bringing good news!</p>
<p>It needed only the excited, happy touch of her
hand to set Brom Bones whirling up the road, for
the big colt understood her ways and moods and
followed them better than he would have followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
whip or rein of another. Half-way, she pulled
the big fellow down to a decorous canter and
gradually slowed down to a walk as Jeffrey came
thundering down upon them. He pulled up
sharply and turned on his hind feet. The two
horses fell into step, as they knew they were expected
to do and their two riders gave them no
more heed than if they had been wooden horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know it was all right, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you coming down Argyle Mountain,&rdquo;
Ruth laughed. &ldquo;You looked as though you were
riding Victory down the top side of the earth.
How did it all come out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the paper,&rdquo; he said, handing her an
Albany newspaper of the day previous; &ldquo;it tells
the story right off. But I got a letter from the
Bishop, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you?&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking up
from the headline&ndash;&ndash;U. &amp; M. Grab Killed in
Committee&ndash;&ndash;which she had been feverishly trying
to translate into her own language. &ldquo;Please
let me hear. I&rsquo;m never sure what headlines mean
till I go down to the fine print, and then it&rsquo;s generally
something else. I can understand what the
Bishop says, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only short,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, unfolding
the letter. &ldquo;He leaves out all the part that he
did himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ruth simply. &ldquo;He always
does.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will see from the Albany papers, which
will probably reach you before this does, that the
special session of the Legislature closed to-night
and that the railroad&rsquo;s bill was not reported to
the Senate. It had passed the Assembly, as you
know. The bill aroused a measure of just public
anger through the newspapers and its authors evidently
thought it the part of wisdom not to risk
a contest over it in the open Senate. So there can
be no legislative action in favour of the railroad
before December at the earliest, and I regard it as
doubtful that the matter will be brought up even
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, &ldquo;from this you&rsquo;d never
know that he was there present at all. And
it was just his speech before the committee
that aroused that public anger. Then he goes
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But we must not make the mistake of presuming
that the matter ends here. You and your
people are just where you were in the beginning.
Nothing has been lost, nothing gained. It is not
in the nature of things that a corporation which
has spent an enormous amount of money in constructing
a line with the one purpose of getting
to your lands should now give up the idea of getting
them by reason of a mere legislative setback.
They have not entered into this business
in any half-hearted manner. They are bound to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
carry it through somehow&ndash;&ndash;anyhow. We must
realise that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We need not speculate upon the soul or the
conscience of a corporation or the lack of those
things. We know that this corporation will have
an answer to this defeat of its bill. We must
watch for that answer. What their future methods
or their plans may be I think no man can tell.
Perhaps those plans are not yet even formed.
But there will be an answer. While rejoicing that
a fear of sound public opinion has been on your
side, we must never forget that there will be an
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In this matter, young sir, I have gone beyond
the limits which men set for the proper activities
of a priest of the church. I do not apologise.
I have done this, partly because your
people are my own, my friends and my comrades
of old, partly because you yourself came to me in
a confidence which I do not forget, partly&ndash;&ndash;and
most, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;because where my people and
their rights are in question I have never greatly
respected those limits which men set. I put these
things before you so that when the answer comes
you will remember that you engaged yourself in
this business solely in defence of the right. So it
is not your personal fight and you must try to
keep from your mind and heart the bitterness of a
quarrel. The struggle is a larger thing than that
and you must keep your heart larger still and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
above it. I fear that you will sorely need to remember
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My sincerest regards to your family and to
all my friends in the hills, not forgetting your
friend Ruth.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, folding
the letter. &ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d said more about how he
managed the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough to know that he did manage it,
without bothering about how? That is the way
he does everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought to be satisfied,&rdquo; said Jeffrey
as he gathered up his reins. &ldquo;But I wonder what
he means by that last part of the letter. It sounds
like a warning to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a warning to you,&rdquo; said Ruth thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what does it mean? What does he
think I&rsquo;m likely to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he does not mean what you are likely
to do exactly,&rdquo; said Ruth, trying to choose her
words wisely; &ldquo;maybe he is thinking more of what
you are likely to feel. Maybe he is talking to
your heart rather than to your head or about your
actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, either,&rdquo;
said Jeffrey a little discontentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I oughtn&rsquo;t to try to tell you what the
Bishop means, for I don&rsquo;t know myself. But I&rsquo;ve
been worried and I&rsquo;m sure your mother has too,&rdquo;
said Ruth reluctantly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; said Jeffrey quickly.
&ldquo;What have I been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t anything you&rsquo;ve done, nor
anything maybe that you&rsquo;re likely to do. I don&rsquo;t
know just what it is, or how to say it. But,
Jeffrey, you remember what you said that day in
the Bishop&rsquo;s house at Alden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I remember what you said, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both meant it,&rdquo; Ruth returned gravely,
not attempting to evade any of the meaning that
he had thrown into his words. &ldquo;And we both
mean it now, I&rsquo;m sure. But there&rsquo;s a difference,
Jeffrey, a difference with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; he said a little shortly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still doing just the thing I started out to do
that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that day you started out to fight
for the people. Now you are fighting for yourself&ndash;&ndash; Oh,
not for anything selfish! Not for
anything you want for yourself! I know that.
But you have made the fight your own. It is your
own quarrel now. You are fighting because you
have come to hate the railroad people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t expect me to love them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not blaming you, Jeff. But&ndash;&ndash;but,
I&rsquo;m afraid. Hate is a terrible thing. I wish you
were out of it all. Hate can only hurt you. I&rsquo;m
afraid of a scar that it might leave on you through
all the long, long years of life. Can you see?
I&rsquo;m afraid of something that might go deeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
than all this, something that might go as deep as
life. After all, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of, I
guess&ndash;&ndash;Life, great, big, terrible, menacing,
Life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life?&rdquo; Jeffrey asked gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have faced that,&rdquo; the girl answered evenly,
&ldquo;just as you have faced it. And I am not afraid
of that. No. It&rsquo;s what you might do in anger&ndash;&ndash;if
they hurt you again. Something that would
scar your heart and your soul. Jeffrey, do you
know that sometimes I&rsquo;ve seen the worst, the worst&ndash;&ndash;even
<i>murder</i> in your eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; the boy returned shortly, &ldquo;the
Bishop would keep his religion out of all this.
He&rsquo;s a good man and a good friend,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like this religion coming into everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can he? He cannot keep religion
apart from life and right and wrong. What
good would religion be if it did not go ahead of
us in life and show us the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; the boy said grudgingly.
&ldquo;What good does it do? You wouldn&rsquo;t have
thought of any of this only for that last part of
his letter. Why does that have to come into
everything? It&rsquo;s the Catholic Church all over
again, always pushing in everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that funny,&rdquo; the girl said, brightening;
&ldquo;I have cried myself sick thinking just that same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
thing. I have gone almost frantic thinking that
if I once gave in to the Church it would crush
me and make me do everything that I didn&rsquo;t want
to do. And now I never think of it. Life goes
along really just as though being a Catholic didn&rsquo;t
make any difference at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve given in to it altogether.
You don&rsquo;t even know that you want to
resist. You&rsquo;re swallowed up in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flushed angrily, but bit her lips before
she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queerest thing, isn&rsquo;t it, Jeff,&rdquo; she said
finally in a thoughtful, friendly way, &ldquo;how two
people can fight about religion? Now you don&rsquo;t
care a particle about it one way or the other.
And I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it. And yet,
we were just now within an inch of quarrelling bitterly
about it. Why is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m sorry, Ruth,&rdquo; the boy
apologised slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my business,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were just coming over the long hill above
Ruth&rsquo;s home. Below them stretched the long
sweep of the road down past her house and up
the other slope until it lost itself around the
shoulder of Lansing Mountain.</p>
<p>Half a mile below them a rider was pushing his
big roan horse up the hill towards them at a heart-breaking
pace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;My&rsquo; Stocking&rsquo;s roan,&rdquo; said Jeffrey,
straightening in his saddle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know that horse
three miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he carrying?&rdquo; cried Ruth excitedly,
as she peered eagerly from under her
shading hand. &ldquo;Look. Across his saddle.
Rifles! <i>Two</i> of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brom Bones, sensing the girl&rsquo;s excitement, was
already pulling at his bit, eager for a wild race
down the hill. But Jeffrey, after one long, sharp
look at the oncoming horseman, pulled in quietly
to the side of the road. And Ruth did the same.
She was too well trained in the things of the hills
not to know that if there was trouble, then it was
no time to be weakening horses&rsquo; knees in mad and
useless dashes downhill.</p>
<p>The rider was Myron Stocking from over in
the Crooked Lake country, as Jeffrey had supposed.
He pulled up as he recognised the two
who waited for him by the roadside, and when
he had nodded to Ruth, whom he knew by sight,
he drew over close to Jeffrey. Ruth, eager as
she was to hear, pushed Brom Bones a few paces
farther away from them. They would not talk
freely in her hearing, she knew. And Jeffrey
would tell her all that she needed to know.</p>
<p>The two men exchanged a half dozen rapid sentences
and Ruth heard Stocking conclude:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Uncle Catty slipped me this here gun
o&rsquo; yours. Your Ma didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>Jeffrey nodded and took the gun. Then he
came to Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some strangers over in the hills that
maybe ought to be watched. The country&rsquo;s awful
dry,&rdquo; he added quietly. He knew that Ruth
would need no further explanation.</p>
<p>He pulled the Bishop&rsquo;s letter from his pocket
and handed it to Ruth, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this and the paper along to Mother.
She&rsquo;ll want to see them right away. And say,
Ruth,&rdquo; he went on, as he looked anxiously at the
great sloping stretches of bone-dry underbrush that
lay between them and his home on the hill three
miles away, &ldquo;the country&rsquo;s awful dry. If anything
happens, get Mother and Aunt Letty down
out of this country. You can make them go.
Nobody else could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had not yet spoken. There was no
need for her to ask questions. She knew what
lay under every one of Jeffrey&rsquo;s pauses and
silences. It was no time for many words. He
was laying upon her a trust to look after the ones
whom he loved.</p>
<p>She put out her hand to his and said simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we didn&rsquo;t quarrel, Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a fool,&rdquo; said Jeffrey gruffly, as he wrung
her hand. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll remember. Forgive me,
please, Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive&ndash;&ndash;ever&ndash;&ndash;between
us, Jeffrey. Go now,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>Jeffrey wheeled his horse and followed the
other man back over the hill on the road which
he and Ruth had come. Ruth sat still until they
were out of sight. At the very last she saw
Jeffrey swing his rifle across the saddle in front of
him, and a shadow fell across her heart. She
would have given everything in her world to have
had back what she had said of seeing murder in
Jeffrey&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Jeffrey and Myron Stocking rode steadily up
the French Village road for an hour or so. Then
they turned off from the road and began a long
winding climb up into the higher levels of the
Racquette country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well head for Bald Mountain
right away,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, as they came about sundown
to a fork in their trail. &ldquo;The breeze comes
straight down from the east. That&rsquo;s where the
danger is, if there is any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right, Jeff. But it means
we&rsquo;ll have to sleep out if we go that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that won&rsquo;t hurt us,&rdquo; Jeffrey returned.
&ldquo;If anything happens we might have to sleep out
a good many nights&ndash;&ndash;and a lot of other people
would have to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; Stocking agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get a bite and give the horses a feed and a rest at
Hosmer&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s about two miles over the hills
here; and then we can go on as far as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Hosmer&rsquo;s they got food enough for two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
days in the hills, and having fed and breathed the
horses they rode on up into the higher woods.
They were now in the region of the uncut timber
where the great trees were standing from the beginning,
because they had been too high up to be
accessible to the lumbermen who had ravaged the
lower levels. Though the long summer twilight
of the North still lighted the tops of the trees, the
two men rode in impenetrable darkness, leaving
the horses to pick their own canny footing up the
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody see Rogers in that crowd?&rdquo;
Jeffrey asked as they rode along. &ldquo;You know,
the man that was in French Village this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Stocking answered. &ldquo;You
see they came up to the end of the rails, at Grafton,
on a handcar. And then they scattered.
Nobody&rsquo;s sure that he&rsquo;s seen any of &rsquo;em since.
But they must be in the hills somewhere. And
Rafe Gadbeau&rsquo;s with &rsquo;em. You can bet on that.
That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got to go on. But it may be
a-plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to set us on the move, anyway,&rdquo;
said Jeffrey. &ldquo;They have no business in the
hills. They&rsquo;re bound to be up to mischief of some
sort. And there&rsquo;s just one big mischief that they
can do. Can we make Bald Mountain before daylight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly; that&rsquo;ll be easy. We&rsquo;ll get a
little light when we&rsquo;re through this belt of heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
woods and then we can push along. We ought
to get up there by two o&rsquo;clock. It ain&rsquo;t light till
near five. That&rsquo;ll give us a little sleep, if we feel
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to Stocking&rsquo;s calculation they came out
upon the rocky, thinly grassed knobs of Bald
Mountain shortly before two o&rsquo;clock. It was a
soft, hazy night with no moon. There was rain
in the air somewhere, for there was no dew; but
it might be on the other side of the divide or it
might be miles below on the lowlands.</p>
<p>Others of the men of the hills were no doubt in
the vicinity of the mountain, or were heading
toward here. For the word of the menace had
gone through the hills that day, and men would decide,
as Jeffrey had done, that the danger would
come from this direction. But they had not
heard anything to show the presence of others,
nor did they care to give any signals of their own
whereabouts.</p>
<p>As for those others, the possible enemy, who
had left the railroad that morning and had scattered
into the hills, if their purpose was the one
that men feared, they, too, would be near here.
But it was useless to look for them in the dark:
neither was anything to be feared from them before
morning. Men do not start forest fires in
the night. There is little wind. A fire would
probably die out of itself. And the first blaze
would rouse the whole country.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>The two hobbled their horses with the bridle
reins and lay down in the open to wait for morning.
Neither had any thought of sleep. But the
softness of the night, the pungent odour of the
tamarack trees floating up to them from below,
and their long ride, soon began to tell on them.
Jeffrey saw that they must set a watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curl up and go to sleep, &lsquo;My,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said,
shaking himself. &ldquo;You might as well. I&rsquo;ll wake
you in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ready snore was the only answer.</p>
<p>Morning coming over the higher eastern hills
found them stiff and weary, but alert. The
woods below them were still banked in darkness
as they ate their dry food and caught their horses
for the day that was before them. There was
no water to be had up here, and they knew their
horses must be gotten down to some water course
before night.</p>
<p>A half circle of open country belted by heavy
woods lay just below them. Eagerly, as the light
crept down the hill, they scanned the area for sign
of man or horse. Nothing moved. Apparently
they had the world to themselves. A fresh morning
breeze came down over the mountain and
watching they could see the ripple of it in the tops
of the distant trees. The same thought made
both men grip their rifles and search more carefully
the ground below them, for that innocent
breeze blowing straight down towards their homes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
and loved ones was a potential enemy more to be
feared than all the doings of men.</p>
<p>Down to the right, two miles or more away, a
man came out of the shadow of the woods. They
could only see that he was a big man and stout.
There was nothing about him to tell them whether
he was friend or foe, of the hills or a stranger.
Without waiting to see who he was or what he
did, the two dove for their saddles and started
their horses pell-mell down the hill towards him.</p>
<p>He saw them at once against the bare brow of
the hill, and ran back into the wood.</p>
<p>In another instant they knew what he was and
what was his business.</p>
<p>They saw a light moving swiftly along the
fringe of the woods. Behind the light rose a trail
of white smoke. And behind the smoke ran a
line of living fire. The man was running, dragging
a flaming torch through the long dried grass
and brush!</p>
<p>The two, riding break-neck down over the rocks,
regardless of paths or horses&rsquo; legs, would gladly
have killed the man as he ran. But it was too far
for even a random shot. They could only ride on
in reckless rage, mad to be at the fire, to beat
it to death with their hands, to stamp it into the
earth, but more eager yet for a right distance and
a fair shot at the fiend there within the wood.</p>
<p>Before they had stumbled half the distance
down the hill, a wave of leaping flame a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
feet long was hurling itself upon the forest.
They could not stamp that fire out. But they
could kill that man!</p>
<p>The man ran back behind the wall of fire to
where he had started and began to run another
line of fire in the other direction. At that moment
Stocking yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another starting, straight in front!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him,&rdquo; Jeffrey shouted over his shoulder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stocking turned slightly and made for a second
light which he had seen starting. Jeffrey rode on
alone, unslinging his rifle and driving madly. His
horse, already unnerved by the wild dash down
the hill, now saw the fire and started to bolt off at
a tangent. Jeffrey fought with him a furious
moment, trying to force him toward the fire and
the man. Then, seeing that he could not conquer
the fright of the horse and that his man was
escaping, he threw his leg over the saddle, and
leaping free with his gun ran towards the
man.</p>
<p>The man was dodging in and out now among
the trees, but still using his torch and moving
rapidly away.</p>
<p>Jeffrey ran on, gradually overhauling the man
in his zigzag until he was within easy distance.
But the man continued weaving his way among the
trees so that it was impossible to get a fair aim.
Jeffrey dropped to one knee and steadied the sights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
of his rifle until they closed upon the running
man and clung to him.</p>
<p>Suddenly the man turned in an open space and
faced about. It was Rogers, Jeffrey saw. He
was unarmed, but he must be killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to kill him,&rdquo; said Jeffrey under
his breath, as he again fixed the sights of his rifle,
this time full on the man&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>A shot rang out in front somewhere. Rogers
threw up his hands, took a half step forward, and
fell on his face.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, his finger still clinging to the trigger
which he had not pulled, ran forward to where
the man lay.</p>
<p>He was lying face down, his arms stretched out
wide at either side, his fingers convulsively clutching
at tufts of grass.</p>
<p>He was dying. No need for a second look.</p>
<p>His hat had fallen off to a little distance.
There was a clean round hole in the back of the
skull. The close-cropped, iron grey hair showed
just the merest streak of red.</p>
<p>Just out of reach of one of his hands lay a still
flaming railroad torch, with which he had done his
work.</p>
<p>Jeffrey peered through the wood in the direction
from which the shot had come. There was
no smoke, no noise of any one running away, no
sign of another human being anywhere.</p>
<p>Away back of him he heard shots, one, two,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
three; Stocking, probably, or some of the other
men who must be in the neighbourhood, firing at
other fleeing figures in the woods.</p>
<p>He grabbed the burning torch, pulled out the
wick and stamped it into a patch of burnt ground,
threw the torch back from the fire line, and started
clubbing the fire out of the grass with the butt of
his rifle.</p>
<p>He was quickly brought to his senses, when the
forgotten cartridge in his gun accidentally exploded
and the bullet went whizzing past his ear.
He dropped the gun nervously and finding a sharp
piece of sapling he began to work furiously, but
systematically at the line of fire.</p>
<p>The line was thin here, where it had really only
that moment been started, and he made some
headway. But as he worked along to where it
had gotten a real start he saw that it was useless.
Still he clung to his work. It was the only thing
that his numbed brain could think of to do for the
moment.</p>
<p>He dug madly with the sapling, throwing the
loose dirt furiously after the fire as it ran away
from him. He leaped upon the line of the fire
and stamped at it with his boots until the fire crept
up his trousers and shirt and up even to his hair.
And still the fire ran away from him, away down
the hill after its real prey. He looked farther
on along the line and saw that it was not now a line
but a charging, rushing river of flame that ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
down the hill, twenty feet at a jump. Nothing,
nothing on earth, except perhaps a deluge of rain
could now stop that torrent of fire.</p>
<p>He stepped back. There was nothing to be
done here now, behind the fire. Nothing to be
done but to get ahead of it and save what could
be saved. He looked around for his horse.</p>
<p>Just then men came riding along the back of the
line, Stocking and old Erskine Beasley in the lead.
They came up to where Jeffrey was standing and
looked on beyond moodily to where the body of
Rogers lay.</p>
<p>Jeffrey turned and looked, too. A silence fell
upon the little group of horsemen and upon the
boy standing there.</p>
<p>Myron Stocking spoke at last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine got away, Jeff,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>Jeffrey looked up quickly at him. Then the
meaning of the words flashed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; he exclaimed hastily.
&ldquo;Somebody else shot him from the woods. My
gun went off accidental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence fell again upon the little group of men.
They did not look at Jeffrey. They had heard
but one shot. The shot from the woods had been
too muffled for them to hear.</p>
<p>Again Stocking broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does it make,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Any of us would have done it if we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t! I tell you I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; shouted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
Jeffrey. &ldquo;The shot from the woods got ahead of
me. That man was facing me. He was shot
from behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Erskine Beasley took command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does it make, as Stocking
says. We&rsquo;ve got live men and women and children
to think about to-day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Straighten
him out decent. Then divide and go around the
fire both ways. The alarm can&rsquo;t travel half fast
enough for this breeze, and it&rsquo;s rising, too,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; Jeffrey began again.
Then he saw how useless it was.</p>
<p>He looked up the hill and saw his horse, which
even in the face of this unheard-of terror had preferred
to venture back toward his master.</p>
<p>He caught the horse, mounted, and started to
ride south with the party that was to try to get
around the fire from that side.</p>
<p>He rode with them. They were his friends.
But he was not with them. There was a circle
drawn around him. He was separated from
them. They probably did not feel it, but he felt
it. It is a circle which draws itself ever around
a man who, justly or unjustly, is thought guilty of
blood. Men may applaud his deed. Men may
say that they themselves would wish to have done
it. But the circle is there.</p>
<p>Then Jeffrey thought of his Mother. She
would not see that circle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>Also he thought of a girl. The girl had only a
few hours before said that she had sometimes seen
even murder in his eyes.</p>

<h3>MON PERE JE ME &rsquo;CUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Down the wide slope of Bald Mountain the
fire raved exultingly, leaping and skipping fantastically
as it ran. It was a prisoner released
from the bondage of the elements that had held
it. It was a spirit drunk with sudden-found freedom.
It was a flood raging down a valley. It
was a maniac at large.</p>
<p>The broad base of the mountain where it sat
upon the backs of the lower hills spread out fanwise
to a width of five miles. The fire spread its
wings as it came down until it swept the whole
apron of the mountain. A five-mile wave of solid
flame rolled down upon the hills.</p>
<p>Sleepy cattle on the hills rising for their early
browse missed the juicy dew from the grass.
They looked to where the sun should be coming
over the mountain and instead they saw the sun
coming down the side of the mountain in a blanket
of white smoke. They left their feed and began
to huddle together, mooing nervously to each
other about this thing and sniffing the air and
pawing the earth.</p>
<p>Sleepy hired men coming out to drive the cattle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
in to milking looked blinking up at the mountain,
stood a moment before their numb minds understood
what their senses were telling them, then
ran shouting back to the farm houses, throwing
open pasture gates and knocking down lengths of
fence as they ran. Some, with nothing but fear
in their hearts, ran straight to the barns and
mounting the best horses fled down the roads to
the west. For the hireling flees because he is a
hireling.</p>
<p>Sleepy men and women and still sleeping children
came tumbling out of the houses, to look up
at the death that was coming down to them.
Some cried in terror. Some raged and cursed and
shook foolish fists at the oncoming enemy. Some
fell upon their knees and lifted hands to the God
of fire and flood. Then each ran back into the
house for his or her treasure; a little bag of money
under a mattress, or a babe in its crib, or a little
rifle, or a dolly of rags.</p>
<p>Frantic horses were hastily hitched to farm
wagons. The treasures were quickly bundled in.
Women pushed their broods up ahead of them into
the wagons, ran back to kiss the men standing at
the heads of the sweating horses, then climbed to
their places in the wagons and took the reins.
For twenty miles, down break-neck roads, behind
mad horses, they would have to hold the lives of
the children, the horses, and, incidentally, of themselves
in their hands. But they were capable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
hands, brown, and strong and steady as the mother
hearts that went with them.</p>
<p>They would have preferred to stay with the
men, these women. But it was the law that they
should take the brood and run to safety.</p>
<p>Men stood watching the wagons until they shot
out of sight behind the trees of the road. Then
they turned back to the hopeless, probably useless
fight. They could do little or nothing. But it
was the law that men must stay and make the
fight. They must go out with shovels to the very
edge of their own clearing and dig up a width of
new earth which the running fire could not cross.
Thus they might divert the fire a little. They
might even divide it, if the wind died down a little,
so that it would roll on to either side of their
homes.</p>
<p>This was their business. There was little
chance that they would succeed. Probably they
would have to drop shovels at the last moment
and run an unequal foot race for their lives. But
this was the law, that every man must stay and try
to make his own little clearing the point of an entering
wedge to that advancing wall of fire. No
man, no ten thousand men could stop the fire.
But, against all probabilities, some one man might
be able, by some chance of the lay of the ground,
or some freak of the wind, to split off a sector of
it. That sector might be fought and narrowed
down by other men until it was beaten. And so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
something would be gained. For this men stayed,
stifled and blinded, and fought on until the last
possible moment, and then ran past their already
smoking homes and down the wind for life.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting rode southward in the wake
of four other men down a long spiral course
towards the base of the mountain. Yesterday he
would have ridden at their head. He would have
taken the place of leadership and command among
them which he had for months been taking in the
fight against the railroad. Probably he could still
have had that place among them if he had tried to
assert himself, for men had come to have a habit
of depending upon him. But he rode at the rear,
dispirited and miserable.</p>
<p>They were trying to get around the fire, so that
they might hang upon its flank and beat it in upon
itself. There was no thought now of getting
ahead of it: no need to ride ahead giving alarm.
That rolling curtain of smoke would have already
aroused every living thing ahead of it.
They could only hope to get to the end of the line
of fire and fight it inch by inch to narrow the path
of destruction that it was making for itself.</p>
<p>If the wind had held stiff and straight down the
mountain it would have driven the fire ahead in a
line only a little wider than its original front.
But the shape of the mountain caught the light
breeze as it came down and twisted it away always
to the side. So that the end of the fire line was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
not a thin edge of scattered fire that could be
fought and stamped back but was a whirling inverted
funnel of flame that leaped and danced ever
outward and onward.</p>
<p>Half way down the mountain they thought that
they had outflanked it. They slid from their
horses and began to beat desperately at the brush
and grasses among the trees. They gained upon
it. They were doing something. They shouted
to each other when they had driven it back even a
foot. They fought it madly for the possession of
a single tree. They were gaining. They were
turning the edge of it in. The hot sweat began to
streak the caking grime upon their faces. There
was no air to breathe, only the hot breath of fire.
But it was heartsome work, for they were surely
pushing the fire in upon itself.</p>
<p>A sudden swirl of the wind threw a dense cloud
of hot white smoke about them. They stood still
with the flannel of their shirt-sleeves pressed over
eyes and nostrils, waiting for it to pass.</p>
<p>When they could look they saw a wall of fire
bearing down upon them from three sides. The
wind had whirled the fire backward and sidewise
so that it had surrounded the meagre little space
that they had cleared and had now outflanked
them. Their own man&oelig;uvre had been turned
against them. There was but one way to run,
straight down the hill with the fire roaring and
panting after them. It was a playful, tricky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
monster that cackled gleefully behind them, laughing
at their puny efforts.</p>
<p>Breathless and spent, they finally ran themselves
out of the path of the flames and dropped
exhausted in safety as the fire went roaring by
them on its way.</p>
<p>Their horses were gone, of course. The fire
in its side leap had caught them and they had fled
shrieking down the hill, following their instinct
to hunt water.</p>
<p>The men now began to understand the work
that was theirs. They were five already weary
men. All day and all night, perhaps, they must
follow the fire that travelled almost as fast as they
could run at their best. And they must hang upon
its edge and fight every inch of the way to fold
that edge back upon itself, to keep that edge from
spreading out upon them. A hundred men who
could have flanked the fire shoulder to shoulder for
a long space might have accomplished what these
five were trying to do. For them it was impossible.
But they hung on in desperation.</p>
<p>Three times more they made a stand and
pushed the edge of the fire back a little, each time
daring to hope that they had done something.
And three times more the treacherous wind
whirled the fire back behind and around them so
that they had to race for life.</p>
<p>Now they were down off the straight slope of
the mountain and among the broken hills. Here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
their work was entirely hopeless and they knew it.
They knew also that they were in almost momentary
danger of being cut off and completely surrounded.
Here the fire did not keep any steady
edge that they could follow and attack. The
wind eddied and whirled about among the broken
peaks of the hills in every direction and with it
the fire ran apparently at will.</p>
<p>When they tried to hold it to one side of a
hill and were just beginning to think that they had
won, a sudden sweep of the wind would send a
ring of fire around to the other side so that they
saw themselves again and again surrounded and
almost cut off.</p>
<p>Ahead of them now there was one hope: to hold
the fire to the north side of the Chain. The
Chain is a string of small lakes running nearly east
and west. It divides the hill country into fairly
even portions. If they could keep the fire north
of the lakes they would save the southern half of
the country. Their own homes all lay to the
north of the lakes and they were now doomed.
But that was a matter that did not enter here.
What was gone was gone. Their loved ones
would have had plenty of warning and would be
out of the way by now. The men were fighting
the enemy merely to save what could be saved.
And as is the way of men in fight they began to
make it a personal quarrel with the fire.</p>
<p>They began to grow blindly angry at their opponent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
It was no longer an impersonal, natural
creature of the elements, that fire. It was a cunning,
a vicious, a mocking enemy. It hated them.
They hated it. Its eyes were red with gloating
over them. Their eyes were red and bloodshot
with the fury of their battle. Its voice was hoarse
with the roar of its laughing at them. Their
voices were thick and their lips were cracking with
the hot curses they hurled back at it.</p>
<p>They had forgotten the beginning of the quarrel.
All but one of them had forgotten the men
whom they had tracked into the hills last night
and who had started the fire. All but one of them
had forgotten those other men, far away and safe
and cowardly, who had sent those men into the
hills to do this thing.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting had not forgotten. But as the
day wore on and the fight waxed more bitter and
more hopeless, even he began to lose sight of the
beginning and to make it his own single feud with
the fire. He fought and was beaten back and
ran and went back to fight again, until there was
but one thought, if it could be called a thought, in
his brain: to fight on, bitterly, doggedly, without
mercy, without quarter given or asked with the
demon of the fire.</p>
<p>Now other men came from scattered, far-flung
homes to the south and joined the five. Two hills
stood between them and Sixth Lake, where the
Chain began and stretched away to the west. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
they could hold the fire to the north of these two
hills then it would sweep along the north side of
the lakes and the other half of the country would
be safe.</p>
<p>The first hill was easy. They took their stand
along its crest. The five weary, scarred, singed
men, their voices gone, their swollen tongues protruding
through their splitting lips, took new
strength from the help that had come to them.
They fought the enemy back down the north side
of the hill, foot by foot, steadily, digging with
charred sticks and throwing earth and small stones
down upon it.</p>
<p>They were beating it at last! Only another
hill like this and their work would be done. They
would strike the lake and water. Water! God
in Heaven! Water! A whole big lake of it!
To throw themselves into it! To sink into its
cool, sweet depth! And to drink, and drink and
<i>drink</i>!</p>
<p>Between the two hills ran a deep ravine heavy
with undergrowth. Here was the worst place.
Here they stood and ran shoulder to shoulder,
fighting waist deep in the brush and long grass,
the hated breath of the fire in their nostrils. And
they held their line. They pushed the fire on past
the ravine and up the north slope of the last hill.
They had won! It could not beat them now!</p>
<p>As he came around the brow of the hill and saw
the shining body of the placid lake below him one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of the new men, who still had voice, raised a shout.
It ran back along the line, even the five who had
no voice croaking out what would have been a
cry of triumph.</p>
<p>But the wind heard them and laughed.
Through the ravine which they had safely crossed
with such mighty labour the playful wind sent a
merry, flirting little gust, a draught. On the
draught the lingering flames went dancing swiftly
through the brush of the ravine and spread out
around the southern side of the hill. Before the
men could turn, the thing was done. The hill
made itself into a chimney and the flames went
roaring to the top of it.</p>
<p>The men fled over the ridge of the hill and
down to the south, to get themselves out of that
encircling death.</p>
<p>When they were beyond the circle of fire on
that side, they saw the full extent of what had befallen
them in what had been their moment of
victory.</p>
<p>Not only would the fire come south of the lake
and the Chain&ndash;&ndash;but they themselves could not
get near the lake.</p>
<p>Water! There it lay, below them, at their feet
almost! And they could not reach it! The fire
was marching in a swift, widening line between
them and the lake. Not so much as a little finger
might they wet in the lake.</p>
<p>Men lay down and wept, or cursed, or gritted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
silent teeth, according to the nature that was in
each.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting stood up, looking towards the
lake. He saw two men pushing a boat into the
lake. Through the shifting curtain of smoke and
waving fire he studied them out of blistered eyes.
They were not men of the hills.</p>
<p>They were!&ndash;&ndash;They were the real enemy!&ndash;&ndash;They
were two of those who had set the fire!
They had not stopped to fight fire. They had
headed straight for the lake and had gotten there.
<i>They</i> were safe. And <i>they</i> had <i>water</i>!</p>
<p>All the hot rage of the morning, seared into him
by the fighting fire fury of the day, rushed back
upon him.</p>
<p>He had not killed a man this morning. Men
said he had, but he had not.</p>
<p>Now he would kill. The fire should not stop
him. He would kill those two there in the water.
<i>In the water!</i></p>
<p>He ran madly down the slope and into the
flaming, fuming maw of the fire. He went blind.
His foot struck a root. He fell heavily forward,
his face buried in a patch of bare earth.</p>
<p>Men ran to the edge of the fire and dragged
him out by the feet. When they had brought him
back to safety and had fanned breath into him with
their hate, he opened bleared eyes and looked at
them. As he understood, he turned on his face
moaning:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill Rogers. I wish I had&ndash;&ndash;I wish
I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And south and north of the Chain the fire rolled
away into the west.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Bishop of Alden looked restlessly out of
the window as the intolerable, sooty train jolted
its slow way northward along the canal and the
Black River. He had left Albany in the very
early hours of the morning. Now it was nearing
noon and there were yet eighty miles, four hours,
of this interminable journey before he could find
a good wash and rest and some clean food. But
he was not hungry, neither was he querulous.
There were worse ways of travel than even by a
slow and dusty train. And in his wide-flung, rock-strewn
diocese the Bishop had found plenty of
them. He was never one to complain. A gentle
philosophy of all life, a long patience that saw and
understood the faults of high and low, a slow,
quiet gleam of New England humour at the back
of his light blue eyes; with Christ, and these
things, Joseph Winthrop contrived to be a very
good man and a very good bishop.</p>
<p>But to-day he was not content with things. He
had done one thing in Albany, or rather, he would
have said, he had seen it done. He had appealed
to the conscience of the people of the State. And
the conscience of the people had replied in no mistakable
terms that the U. &amp; M. Railroad must not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
dare to drive the people of the hills from their
homes for the sake of what might lie beneath their
land. Then the conscience of the people of the
State had gone off about its business, as the public
conscience has a way of doing. The public would
forget. The public always forgets. He had furnished
it with a mild sensation which had aroused
it for a time, a matter of a few days at most.
He did not hope for even the proverbial nine days.
But the railroad would not forget. It never slept.
For there were men behind it who said, and kept
on saying, that they must have results.</p>
<p>He was sure that the railroad would strike back.
And it would strike in some way that would be effective,
but that yet would hide the hand that
struck.</p>
<p>Thirty miles to the right of him as he rode
north lay the line of the first hills. Beyond them
stood the softly etched outlines of the mountains,
their white-blue tones blending gently into the
deep blue of the sky behind them.</p>
<p>Forty miles away he could make out the break
in the line where Old Forge lay and the Chain began.
Beyond that lay Bald Mountain and the divide.
But he could not see Bald Mountain.
That was strange. The day was very clear. He
had noticed that there had been no dew that morning.
There might have been a little haze on the
hills in the early morning. But this sun would
have cleared that all away by now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>Bald Mountain was as one of the points of the
compass on his journey up this side of his diocese.
He had never before missed it on a fair
day. It was something more to him than a mere
bare rock set on the top of other rocks. It was
one of his marking posts. And when you remember
that his was a charge of souls scattered
over twenty thousand square miles of broken
country, you will see that he had need of marking
posts.</p>
<p>Bald Mountain was the limit of the territory
which he could reach from the western side of his
diocese. When he had to go into the country to
the east of the mountain he must go all the way
south to Albany and around by North Creek or
he must go all the way north and east by Malone
and Rouses Point and then south and west again
into the mountains. The mountain was set in almost
the geographical centre of his diocese and
he had travelled towards it from north, east, south
and west.</p>
<p>He missed his mountain now and rubbed his
eyes in a troubled, perplexed way. When the
train stopped at the next little station he went out
on the platform for a clearer, steadier view.</p>
<p>Again he rubbed his eyes. The clear gap between
the hills where he knew Old Forge nestled
was gone. The open rift of sky that he had
recognised a few moments before was now filled,
as though a mountain had suddenly been moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
into the gap. He went back to his seat and sat
watching the line of the mountains. As he
watched, the whole contour of the hills that he
had known was changed under his very eyes.
Peaks rose where never were peaks before, and
rounded, smooth skulls of mountains showed
against the sky where sharp peaks should have
been.</p>
<p>He looked once more, and a sharp, swift suspicion
shot into his mind, and stayed. Then a
just and terrible anger rose up in the soul of
Joseph Winthrop, Bishop of Alden, for he was a
man of gentle heart whose passions ran deep below
a placid surface.</p>
<p>At Booneville he stepped off the train before
it had stopped and hurried to the operator&rsquo;s window
to ask if any news had gone down the wire of
a fire in the hills.</p>
<p>Jerry Hogan, the operator, sat humped up over
his table &ldquo;listening in&rdquo; with shameless glee to
a flirtatious conversation that was going over the
wire, contrary to all rules and regulations of the
Company, between the young lady operator at
Snowden and the man in the office at Steuben.</p>
<p>The Bishop asked a hurried, anxious question.</p>
<p>Without looking up, Jerry answered sorrowfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t the bulletin board. We&rsquo;re busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop stood quiet a moment.</p>
<p>Then Jerry looked up. The face looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
calmly through the window was the face of one
who had once tapped him on the cheek as a reminder
of certain things.</p>
<p>Jerry fell off his high stool, landing, miraculously,
on his feet. He grabbed at his front lock
of curly red hair and gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m sorry, Bishop! I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t hear
what you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop&ndash;&ndash;if one might say it&ndash;&ndash;grinned.
Then he said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw signs of fire in the hills.
Have you heard anything on the wire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had seen the wrinkles around the Bishop&rsquo;s
mouth. The beet red colour of his face had gone
down several degrees. The freckles were coming
back. He was now coherent.</p>
<p>No he had not heard anything. He was sure
nothing had come down the wire. Just then the
rapid-fire, steady clicking of the key changed
abruptly to the sharp, staccato insistence of a
&ldquo;call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry held up his hand. &ldquo;Lowville calling
Utica,&rdquo; he said. They waited a little and then:
&ldquo;Call State Warden. Fire Beaver Run country.
Call everything,&rdquo; Jerry repeated from the
sounder, punctuating for the benefit of the Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be big, Bishop,&rdquo; he said, turning, &ldquo;or
they wouldn&rsquo;t call&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Bishop was already running for the
steps of his departing train.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>At Lowville he left the train and hurried to
Father Brady&rsquo;s house. Finding the priest out on
a call, he begged a hasty lunch from the housekeeper,
and, commandeering some riding clothes
and Father Brady&rsquo;s saddle horse, he was soon on
the road to French Village and the hills.</p>
<p>It was before the days of the rural telephone
and there was no telegraph up the hill road. A
messenger had come down from the hills a half
hour ago to the telegraph office. But there was
no alarm among the people of Lowville, for there
lay twenty miles of well cultivated country between
them and the hills. If they noticed Father
Brady&rsquo;s clothes riding furiously out toward
the hill road, they gave the matter no more than
a mild wonder.</p>
<p>For twenty-two miles the Bishop rode steadily
up the hard dirt road over which he and Arsene
LaComb had struggled in the beginning of the
winter before. He thought of Tom Lansing, who
had died that night. He thought of the many
things that had in some way had their beginning
on that night, all leading up, more or less, to this
present moment. But more than all he thought
of Jeffrey Lansing and other desperate men up
there in the hills fighting for their lives and their
little all.</p>
<p>He did not know who had started this fire. It
might well have started accidentally. He did not
know that the railroad people had sent men into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the hills to start it. But if they had, and if those
men were caught by the men of the hills, then
there would be swift and bloody justice done.
The Bishop thought of this and he rode Father
Brady&rsquo;s horse as that good animal had never been
ridden in the course of his well fed life.</p>
<p>Nearing Corben&rsquo;s, he saw that the horse could
go but little farther. Registering a remonstrance
to Father Brady, anent the matter of keeping
his horse too fat, he rode up to bargain with
Corben for a fresh horse. Corben looked at the
horse from which the Bishop had just slid
swiftly down. He demanded to know the Bishop&rsquo;s
destination in the hills&ndash;&ndash;which was vague,
and his business&ndash;&ndash;which was still more vague.
He looked at the Bishop. He closed one eye and
reviewed the whole matter critically. Finally he
guessed that the Bishop could have the fresh
horse if he bought and paid for it on the spot.</p>
<p>The Bishop explained that he did not have the
money about him. Corben believed that. The
Bishop explained that he was the bishop of the
diocese. Corben did not believe that.</p>
<p>In the end the Bishop, chafing at the delay,
persuaded the man to believe him and to accept
his surety for the horse. And taking food in his
pockets he pressed on into the high hills.</p>
<p>Already he had met wagons loaded with women
and children on the road. But he knew that they
would be of those who lived nearest the fringe of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
the hills. They would know little more than he
did himself of the origin of the fire or of what
was going on up there under and beyond that pall
of smoke. So he did not stop to question them.</p>
<p>Now the road began to be dotted with these
wagons of the fleeing ones, and some seemed to
have come far. Twice he stopped long enough
to ask a question or two. But their replies gave
him no real knowledge of the situation. They
had been called from their beds in the early morning
by the fire. Their men had stayed, the
women had fled with the children. That was all
they could tell.</p>
<p>As he came to Lansing Mountain, he met Ruth
Lansing on Brom Bones escorting Mrs. Whiting
and Letitia Bascom. From this the Bishop knew
without asking that the fire was now coming near,
for these women would not have left their homes
except in the nearness of danger.</p>
<p>In fact the two older women had only yielded
to the most peremptory authority, exercised by
Ruth in the name of Jeffrey Whiting. Even to
the end gentle Letitia Bascom had rebelled vigorously
against the idea that Cassius Bascom, who
was notoriously unable to look after himself in
the most ordinary things of life, should now be
left behind on the mere argument that he was a
man.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s first question concerned Jeffrey
Whiting. Ruth told what she knew. That a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
man had met herself and Jeffrey on the road yesterday;
that the man had brought news of strange
men being seen in the hills; that Jeffrey had ridden
away with him toward Bald Mountain.</p>
<p>The Bishop understood. Bald Mountain
would be the place to be watched. He could even
conjecture the night vigil on the mountain, and
the breaking of the fire in the dawn. He could
see the desperate and futile struggle with the fire
as it reached down to the hills. Back of that
screen of fire there was the setting of a tragedy
darker even than the one of the fire itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had my letter?&rdquo; the Bishop asked, when
he had heard all that Ruth had to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We had just read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went armed?&rdquo; said the Bishop quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myron Stocking brought Jeffrey&rsquo;s gun to
him,&rdquo; the girl answered simply, with a full knowledge
of all that the question and answer implied.
The men had gone armed, prepared to kill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will all be driven in upon French Village,&rdquo;
said the Bishop slowly. &ldquo;The wind will
not hold any one direction in the high hills. Little
Tupper Lake may be the only refuge for all
in the end. The road from here there, is it open,
do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has come down from that far,&rdquo; said
Ruth. &ldquo;We have watched the people on the
road all day. But probably they would not leave
the lake. And if they did they would go north
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
by the river. But the road certainly won&rsquo;t be
open long. The fire is spreading north as it
comes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must hurry, then,&rdquo; said the Bishop, gripping
his reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you cannot, you must not!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ruth. &ldquo;You will be trapped. You can never go
through. We are the last to leave, except a few
men with fast horses who know the country every
step. You cannot go through on the road, and if
you leave it you will be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can always come back,&rdquo; said the
Bishop lightly, as he set his horse up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot. Won&rsquo;t you listen, please,
Bishop,&rdquo; Ruth pleaded after him. &ldquo;The fire may
cross behind you, and you&rsquo;ll be trapped on the
road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Bishop was already riding swiftly up
the hill. Whether he heard or not, he did not
answer or look back.</p>
<p>Ruth sat in her saddle looking up the road after
him. She did not know whether or not he realised
his danger. Probably he did, for he was a
quick man to weigh things. Even the knowledge
of his danger would not drive him back. She
knew that.</p>
<p>She knew the business upon which he went.
No doubt it was one in which he was ready to
risk his life. He had said that they would all
be driven in upon Little Tupper. In that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
meant hunters and hunted alike. For there were
the hunters and the hunted. The men of the hills
would be up there behind the wall of fire or working
along down beside it. But while they fought
the fire they would be hunting the brush and the
smoke for the traces of other men. Those other
men would maybe be trapped by the swift running
of the fire. All might be driven to seek safety
together. The hunted men would flee from the
fire to a death just as certain but which they would
prefer to face.</p>
<p>The Bishop was riding to save the lives of
those men. Also he was riding to keep the men
of the hills from murder. Jeffrey would be
among them. Only yesterday she had spoken
that word to him.</p>
<p>But he can do neither, she thought. He will
be caught on the road, and before he will give in
and turn back he will be trapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going back to the top of the hill,&rdquo; she
said suddenly to Mrs. Whiting. &ldquo;I want to see
what it looks like now. Go on down. I will
catch you before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We will pull in at the side of the road
here and wait for you. Don&rsquo;t go past the hill.
We&rsquo;ll wait. There&rsquo;s no danger down here yet,
and won&rsquo;t be for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brom Bones made short work of the hill, for
he was fresh and all day long he had been held
in tight when he had wanted to run away. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
did not know what that thing was from which he
had all day been wanting to run. But he knew
that if he had been his own master he would have
run very far, hunting water. So now he bolted
quickly to the top of the hill.</p>
<p>But the Bishop, too, was riding a fresh horse
and was not sparing him. When Ruth came to
the top of the hill she saw the Bishop nearly a
mile away, already past her own home and mounting
the long hill.</p>
<p>She stood watching him, undecided what to do.
The chances were all against him. Perhaps he
did not understand how certainly those chances
stood against him. And yet, he looked and rode
like a man who knew the chances and was ready
to measure himself against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brom Bones could catch him, I think,&rdquo; she
said as she watched him up the long hill. &ldquo;But
we could not make him come back until it was too
late. I wonder if I am afraid to try. No, I
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m afraid. Only somehow he seems&ndash;&ndash;seems
different. He doesn&rsquo;t seem just like a
man that was reckless or ignorant of his danger.
No. He knows all about it. But it doesn&rsquo;t
count. He is a man going on business&ndash;&ndash;God&rsquo;s
business. I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she saw him against the rim of the sky
as he went over the brow of the hill, where
Jeffrey and she had stopped yesterday. He was
not a pretty figure of a rider. He rode stiffly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
for he was very tired from the unusual ride, and
he crouched forward, saving his horse all that he
could, but he was a figure not easily to be forgotten
as he disappeared over the crown of the hill,
seeming to ride right on into the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly she felt Brom Bones quiver under her.
He was looking away to the right of the long, terraced
hill before her. The fire was coming,
sweeping diagonally down across the face of the
hill straight toward her home.</p>
<p>All her life she had been hearing of forest fires.
Hardly a summer had passed within her memory
when the menace of them had not been present
among the hills. She had grown up, as all hill
children did, expecting to some day have to fly
for her life before one. But she had never before
seen a wall of breathing fire marching down
a hill toward her.</p>
<p>For moments the sight held her enthralled in
wonder and awe. It was a living thing, moving
down the hillside with an intelligent, defined
course for itself. She saw it chase a red deer
and a silver fox down the hill. It could not catch
those timid, fleet animals in the open chase. But
if they halted or turned aside it might come upon
them and surround them.</p>
<p>While she looked, one part of her brain was
numbed by the sight, but the other part was thinking
rapidly. This was not the real fire. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
was only one great paw of fire that shot out before
the body, to sweep in any foolish thing that
did not at first alarm hurry down to the level lands
and safety.</p>
<p>The body of the fire, she was sure, was coming
on in a solid front beyond the hill. It would not
yet have struck the road up which the Bishop was
hurrying. He might think that he could skirt past
it and get into French Village before it should
cross the road. But she was sure he could not
do so. He would go on until he found it
squarely before him. Then he would have to turn
back. And here was this great limb of fire already
stretching out behind him. In five minutes
he would be cut off. The formation of the
hills had sent the wind whirling down through a
gap and carrying one stream of fire away ahead
of the rest. The Bishop did not know the country
to the north of the road. If he left the road
he could only flounder about and wander aimlessly
until the fire closed in upon him.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s decision was taken on the instant. The
two women did not need her. They would
know enough to drive on down to safety when
they saw the fire surely coming. There was a
man gone unblinking into a peril from which he
would not know how to escape. He had gone to
save life. He had gone to prevent crime. If he
stayed in the road she could find him and lead him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
out to the north and probably to safety. If he did
not stay in the road, well, at least, she could only
make the attempt.</p>
<p>Brom Bones went flying along the slope of the
road towards his home. For the first time in his
life, he felt the cut of a whip on his flanks&ndash;&ndash;to
make him go faster. He did not know what it
meant. Nothing like that had ever been a part
of Brom Bones&rsquo; scheme of life, for he had always
gone as fast as he was let go. But it did
not need the stroke of the whip to madden him.</p>
<p>Down across the slope of the hill in front of
him he saw a great, red terror racing towards the
road which he travelled. If he could not understand
the girl&rsquo;s words, he could feel the thrill of
rising excitement in her voice as she urged him
on, saying over and over:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can make it, Brom! I know you can!
I never struck you this way before, did I? But
it&rsquo;s for life&ndash;&ndash;a good man&rsquo;s life! You can make
it. I know you can make it. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you
to if I didn&rsquo;t know. You can make it! It won&rsquo;t
hurt us a bit. It <i>can&rsquo;t</i> hurt us! Bromie, dear,
I tell you it can&rsquo;t hurt us. It just can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crouched out over the horse&rsquo;s shoulder,
laying her weight upon her hands to even it for
the horse. She stopped striking him, for she saw
that neither terror nor punishment could drive him
faster than he was going. He was giving her the
best of his willing heart and fleet body.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>But would it be enough? Fast as she raced
along the road she saw that red death whirling
down the hillside, to cross the road at a
point just above her home. Could she pass that
point before the fire came? She did not know.
And when she came to within a hundred yards of
where the fire would strike the road she still did
not know whether she could pass it. Already she
could feel the hot breath of it panting down upon
her. Already showers of burning leaves and
branches were whirling down upon her head and
shoulders. If her horse should hesitate or bolt
sidewise now they would both be burned to death.
The girl knew it. And, crouching low, talking
into his mane, she told him so. Perhaps he, too,
knew it. He did not falter. Head down, he
plunged straight into the blinding blast that swept
across the road.</p>
<p>A wave of heavy, choking smoke struck him in
the face. He reeled and reared a little, and a
moaning whinny of fright broke from him. But
he felt the steady, strong little hands in his mane
and he plunged on again, through the smoke and
out into the good air.</p>
<p>The fire laughed and leaped across the road
behind them. It had missed them, but it did not
care. The other way, it would not have cared,
either.</p>
<p>Ruth eased Brom Bones up a little on the long
slope of the hill, and turning looked back at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
home. The farmer had long since gone away
with his family. The place was not his. The
flames were already leaping up from the grass
to the windows and the roof was taking fire from
the cinders and burning branches in the air. But,
where everything was burning, where a whole
countryside was being swept with the broom of
destruction, her personal loss did not seem to matter
much.</p>
<p>Only when she saw the flames sweep on past
the house and across the hillside and attack the
trees that stood guard over the graves of her
loved ones did the bitterness of it enter her soul.
She revolted at the cruel wickedness of it all.
Her heart hated the fire. Hated the men who
had set it. (She was sure that men <i>had</i> set it.)
She wanted vengeance. The Bishop was wrong.
Why should he interfere? Let men take revenge
in the way of men.</p>
<p>But on the instant she was sorry and breathed
a little prayer of and for forgiveness. You see,
she was rather a downright young person. And
she took her religion at its word. When she
said, &ldquo;Forgive us our trespasses,&rdquo; she meant just
that. And when she said, &ldquo;As we forgive those
who trespass against us,&rdquo; she meant that, too.</p>
<p>The Bishop was right, of course. One horror,
one sin, would not heal another.</p>
<p>Coming to the top of the hill, the full wonder
and horror of the fire burst upon her with appalling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
force. What she had so far seen was but
a little finger of the fire, crooked around a hill.
Now in front and to the right of her, in an unbroken
quarter circle of the whole horizon, there
ranged a living, moving mass of flame that seemed
to be coming down upon the whole world.</p>
<p>She knew that it was already behind her. If
she had thought of herself, she would have turned
Brom Bones to the left, away from the road and
have fled away, by paths she knew well, to the
north and out of the range of the moving terror.
But only for one quaking little moment did she
think of herself. Along that road ahead of her
there was a man, a good man, who rode bravely,
unquestioningly, to almost certain death, for
others. She could save him, perhaps. So far as
she could see, the fire was not yet crossing the
road in front. The Bishop would still be on the
road. She was sure of that. Again she asked
Brom Bones for his brave best.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Bishop was beginning to think that he
might yet get through to French Village. His
watch told him that it was six o&rsquo;clock. Soon the
sun would be going down, though in the impenetrable
tenting of white smoke that had spread high
over all the air there was nothing to show that
a sun had ever shone upon the earth. With the
going down of the sun the wind, too, would probably
die away. The fire had not yet come to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
road in front of him. If the wind fell the fire
would advance but slowly, and would hardly
spread to the north at all.</p>
<p>He was not discrediting the enemy in front.
He had seen the mighty sweep of the fire and
he knew that it would need but the slightest shift
of the wind to send a wall of flame down upon
him from which he would have to run for his
life. He did not, of course, know that the fire
had already crossed the road behind him. But
even if he had, he would probably have kept on
trusting to the chance of getting through somehow.</p>
<p>He was ascending another long slope of country
where the road ran straight up to the east.
The fire was already to the right of him, sweeping
along in a steady march to the west. It was
spreading steadily northward, toward the road;
but he was hoping that the hill before him had
served to hold it back, that it had not really
crossed the road at any point, and that when he
came to the top of this hill he would be able to
see the road clear before him up to French Village.
He was wearied to the point of exhaustion,
and his nervous horse fought him constantly in
an effort to bolt from the road and make off to
the north. But, he argued, he had suffered nothing
so far from the fire; and there was no real
reason to be discouraged.</p>
<p>Then he came to the top of the hill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>He rubbed his eyes, as he had done a long, long
time before on that same day. Five hundred
yards before him as he looked down a slight
slope, a belt of pine trees was burning high to
the sky. The road ran straight through that.
Behind and beyond the belt of pines he could see
the whole country banked in terraces of flame.
There was no road. This hill had divided the
wind, and thus, temporarily, it had divided the
fire. Already the fire had run away to the north,
and it was still moving northward as it also advanced
more slowly to the top of the hill where
he stood.</p>
<p>Well, the road was still behind him. Nothing
worse had happened than he had, in reason, anticipated.
He must go back. He turned the
horse and looked.</p>
<p>Across the ridge of the last hill that he had
passed the fire was marching majestically. The
daylight, such as it had been, had given its place
to the great glow of the fire. Ten minutes ago
he could not have distinguished anything back
there. Now he could see the road clearly marked,
nearly five miles away, and across it stood a solid
wall of fire.</p>
<p>There were no moments to be lost. He was cut
off on three sides. The way out lay to the north,
over he knew not what sort of country. But at
least it was a way out. He must not altogether
run away from the fire, for in that way he might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
easily be caught and hemmed in entirely. He
must ride along as near as he could in front of
it. So, if he were fast enough, he might turn the
edge of it and be safe again. He might even
be able to go on his way again to French Village.</p>
<p>Yes, if he were quick enough. Also, if the
fire played no new trick upon him.</p>
<p>His horse turned willingly from the road and
ran along under the shelter of the ridge of the hill
for a full mile as fast as the Bishop dared let
him go. He could not drive. He was obliged
to trust the horse to pick his own footing. It
was mad riding over rough pasture land and brush,
but it was better to let the horse have his own
way.</p>
<p>Suddenly they came to the end of the ridge
where the Bishop might have expected to be able
to go around the edge of the fire. The horse
stood stock still. The Bishop took one quiet,
comprehensive look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, boy,&rdquo; he said gently to the horse.
&ldquo;You have done your best. And I&ndash;&ndash;have done
my worst. You did not deserve this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking down toward Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork,
a dry water course, two miles away and a thousand
feet below.</p>
<p>The fire had come clear around the hill and
had been driven down into the heavy timber along
the water course. There it was raging away to
the west down through the great trees, travelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
faster than any horse could have been driven.</p>
<p>The Bishop looked again. Then he turned in
his saddle, thinking mechanically. To the east
the fire was coming over the ridge in an unbroken
line&ndash;&ndash;death. From the south it was advancing
slowly but with a calm and certain steadiness of
purpose&ndash;&ndash;death. On the hill to the west it was
burning brightly and running speedily to meet that
swift line of fire coming down the northern side
of the square&ndash;&ndash;death. One narrowing avenue
of escape was for the moment open. The lines
on the north and the west had not met. For some
minutes, a pitifully few minutes, there would be
a gap between them. The horse, riderless and
running by the instinct of his kind might make
that gap in time. With a rider and stumbling
under weight, it was useless to think of it.</p>
<p>With simple, characteristic decision, the Bishop
slid a tired leg over the horse and came heavily
to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done well, boy, you shall have your
chance,&rdquo; he said, as he hurried to loosen the heavy
saddle and slip the bridle.</p>
<p>He looked again. There was no chance. The
square of fire was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stay together, then.&rdquo; And the Bishop
mounted again.</p>
<p>Within the four walls of breathing death that
were now closing around them there was one
slender possibility of escape. It was not a hope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
No. It was just a futile little tassel on the fringe
of life. Still it was to be played with to the
last. For that again is the law, applying equally
to this bishop and to the little hunted furry things
that ran through the grass by his horse&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>One fire was burning behind the other. There
was just a possibility that a place might be found
where the first fire would have burned away a
breathing place before the other fire came up to
it. It might be possible to live in that place until
the second fire, finding nothing to eat, should
die. It might be possible. Thinking of this, the
Bishop started slowly down the hill toward the
west.</p>
<p>Also, Joseph Winthrop, Bishop of Alden,
thought of death. How should a bishop die?
He remembered Saint Paul, on bishops. But
there seemed to be nothing in those passages that
bore on the matter immediately in hand.</p>
<p>Joseph Winthrop, a simple man, direct and unafraid,
guessed that he would die very much as
another man would die, with his rosary in his
hand.</p>
<p>But was there not a certain ignominy in being
trapped here as the dumb and senseless brute creatures
were being trapped? For the life of him,
the Bishop could no more see ignominy in the
matter or the manner of the thing than he could
see heroism.</p>
<p>He had come out on a bootless errand, to save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
the lives of certain men, if it might be. God had
not seen wisdom in his plan. That was all. He
had meant well. God meant better.</p>
<p>Into these quiet reflections the voice of a girl
broke insistently with a shrill hail. A horse somewhere
neighed to his horse, and the Bishop realised
with a start of horror that a woman was here
in this square of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Bishop, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the voice cried
frantically. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d never find you.
Over here to the right. Let your horse come.
He&rsquo;ll follow mine. The Gaunt Rocks,&rdquo; she
yelled back over her shoulder, &ldquo;we can make them
yet! There&rsquo;s nothing there to burn. We may
smother. But we won&rsquo;t <i>burn</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the Bishop found himself and his horse
taken swiftly under command. It was Ruth
Lansing, he recognised, but there was no time to
think how she had gotten into this fortress of
death. His horse followed Brom Bones through
a whirl of smoke and on up a break-neck path of
loose stones. Before the Bishop had time to get
a fair breath or any knowledge of where he was
going, he found himself on the top of what seemed
to be a pile of flat, naked rocks.</p>
<p>They stopped, and Ruth was already down and
talking soothingly to Brom Bones when the Bishop
got his feet to the rocks. Looking around he
saw that they were on a plateau of rock at least
several acres in extent and perhaps a hundred feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
above the ground about them. Looking down he
saw the sea of fire lapping now at the very foot
of the rocks below. They had not been an instant
too soon. As he turned to speak to the
girl, his eye was caught by something that ran
out of one of the lines of fire. It ran and fell
headlong upon the lowest of the rocks. Then it
stirred and began crawling up the rocks.</p>
<p>It was a man coming slowly, painfully, on hands
and knees up the side of the refuge. The Bishop
went down a little to help. As the two came
slowly to the top of the plateau, Ruth stood there
waiting. The Bishop brought the man to his feet
and stood there holding him in the light. The
face of the newcomer was burned and swollen beyond
any knowing. But in the tall, loose-jointed
figure Ruth easily recognised Rafe Gadbeau.</p>
<p>The man swayed drunkenly in the Bishop&rsquo;s
arms for a moment, then crumpled down inert.
The Bishop knelt, loosening the shirt at the neck
and holding the head of what he was quick to fear
was a dying man.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes opened and in the strong light
he evidently recognised the Bishop&rsquo;s grimy collar,
for out of his cracked and swollen lips there came
the moan:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Mon Pere, je me &rsquo;cuse&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>With a start, Ruth recognised the words.
They were the form in which the French people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
began the telling of their sins in confession. And
she hurriedly turned away toward the horses.</p>
<p>She smiled wearily as she leaned against Brom
Bones, thinking of Jeffrey Whiting. Here was
one of the things that he did not like&ndash;&ndash;the Catholic
Church always turning up in everything.</p>
<p>She wondered where he was and what he was
doing and thinking, up there behind that awful
veil of red.</p>

<a name='VI_THE_BUSINESS_OF_THE_SHEPHERD' id='VI_THE_BUSINESS_OF_THE_SHEPHERD'></a>
<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>THE BUSINESS OF THE SHEPHERD</h3>
</div>
<p>The Bishop laid the man&rsquo;s head back so that
he lay as easy as it was possible and spoke a word
or two in that astonishing French of his which
was the wonder and the peculiar pride of all the
North Country.</p>
<p>But for a long time the man seemed unable to
go farther. He saw the Bishop slip the little
pocket stole around his neck and seemed to know
what it was and what it was for. The swollen
lips, however, only continued to mumble the words
with which they had begun:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Mon Pere, je me &rsquo;cuse</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rafe Gadbeau could speak English as well as or
better than he could speak French. But there
are times when a man reverts to the tongue of his
mother. And confession, especially in the face
of death, is one of these.</p>
<p>Again the Bishop lowered the man&rsquo;s head and
changed the position of the body, while he fanned
what air there was across the gasping mouth with
his hat.</p>
<p>Now the man tried to gather his straying wits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
to him. With a sharp effort that seemed to send
a tremor through his whole long body he forced
his faculties back into their grooves. With a muttered
word of encouragement from the Bishop,
he began hoarsely that precise, recitative form of
confession that the good priests of Lower Canada
have been drilling into the children for the last
three hundred years.</p>
<p>Once the memory found itself going the long-accustomed
way it worked easily, mechanically.
Since five years he had not confessed. At that
time he had received the Sacrament. He went
through the &ldquo;table of sins&rdquo; with the methodical
care of a man who knows that if he misses a step
in the sequence he will lose his way. It was the
story of the young men of his people in the hills,
in the lumber camps, in the sawmills, in the
towns. A thousand men of his kind in the hill
country would have told the same story, of hard
work and anger and fighting in the camps, of
drink and debauch in the towns when they went
down to spend their money; and would have told
it in exactly the same way. The Bishop had
heard the story ten thousand times.</p>
<p>But now&ndash;&ndash;<i>Mon Pere, je me &rsquo;cuse</i>&ndash;&ndash;there
was something more, something that would not
fall into the catalogue of the sins of every day.
It had begun a long time ago and it was just coming
to an end here at the feet of the Bishop.
Yes, it was undoubtedly coming to an end. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the Bishop had found blood caked on the man&rsquo;s
shirt, in the back, just below the shoulder blade.
There was a wound there, a bullet wound, a
wound from which ordinarily the man would have
fallen and stayed lying where he fell.</p>
<p>He must tell this thing in his own way, backwards,
as it unrolled itself to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I die, Mon Pere, I die,&rdquo; he began between
gasps. &ldquo;I die. Since the afternoon I have been
dying. If I could have found a spot to lie down,
if I could have had two minutes free from the
fire, I would have lain down to die. But shall a
man lie down in hell before he is dead? No.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day I have run from the fire. I could
not lie down to die till I had found a free place
where my soul could breathe out. Here I
breathe. Here I die. The rabbits and the foxes
and the deer ran out from the fire, and they ran
no faster than I ran. But I could not run out of
its way. All day long men followed the line of
the fire and fought around its edge. They fought
the fire, but they hunted me. All the day long
they hunted me and drove me always back into the
fire when I would run out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hunted me because in the early morning
they had seen me with the men who set the
fire. No. I did not do that. I did not set hand
to the fire. Why was I with those men? Why
did I go with them when they went to set the fire?
Ah, that is a longer tale.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Four years ago I was in Utica. It was in
a drinking place. All were drinking. There was
a fight. A man was killed. I struck no blow.
<i>Mon Pere</i>, I struck no blow. But my knife&ndash;&ndash;my
knife was found in the man&rsquo;s heart. Who
struck? I know not. A detective for this railroad
that comes now into the hills found my knife.
He traced it to me. He showed the knife to me.
It was mine. I could not deny. But he said no
word to the law. With the knife he could hang
me. But he said no word. Only to me he said,
&lsquo;Some day I may need you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last winter that man the detective came into
the hills. Now he was not a detective. He was
Rogers. He was the agent for the railroad. He
would buy the land from the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people would not sell. You know of
the matter. In June he came again. He was
angry, because other men above him were angry.
He must force the people to sell. He must trick
the people. He saw me. &lsquo;You,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I
need you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Pere</i>, that man owned me. On the
point of my knife, like a pinch of salt, he held my
life. Never a moment when I could say, I will
do this, I will do that. Always I must do his
bidding. For him I lied to my own people. For
him I tricked my friends. For him I nearly killed
the young Whiting. Always I must do as he told.
He called and I came. He bade me do and I did.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieur does not know the sin of hate. It
is the wild beast of all sins. And fear, too, that
is the father of sin. For fear begets hate. And
hate goes raging to do all sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, after fear, came hate into my heart. Before
my eyes was always the face of this man,
threatening with that knife of mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, in the morning came a message
that I must meet him at the railroad. He would
come to the end of the rail and we would go up
into the high hills. I knew what was to be done.
To myself, I rebelled. I would not go. I swore
I would not go. A girl, a good girl that loved me,
begged me not to go. To her I swore I would
not go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went. Fear, <i>Mon Pere</i>, fear is the father
of all. I went because there was that knife before
my eyes. I believe that good girl followed
into the high hills, hoping, maybe, to bring me
back at the last moment. I do not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went because I must go. I must be there
in case any one should see. If any of us that went
was to be caught, I was to be caught. I must be
seen. I must be known to have been there. If
any one was to be punished, I was that one.
Rogers must be free, do you see. I would have
to take the blame. I would not dare to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the night we skulked by Bald Mountain.
We were seven. And of the seven I alone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
was to take the blame. They would swear it upon
me. I knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never once did Rogers let me get beyond the
reach of his tongue. And his speech was, &lsquo;You
owe me this. Now you must pay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first light the torches were got ready.
We scattered along the fringe of the highest trees.
Rogers kept me with him. A moment he went
out into the clearing. Then he came running
back. He had seen other men watching for us.
I ran a little way. He came running behind with
a lighted torch, setting fire as he ran. He yelled
to me to light my torch. Again I ran, deeper
into the wood. Again he came after me, the red
flare of the fire running after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu! The red flare of the fire in the
wood! The red rush of fire in the air! The red
flame of fire in my heart! Fear! Hate!
Fire!&rdquo; With a terrible convulsion the man drew
himself up in the Bishop&rsquo;s arms, gazing wildly at
the fire all about them, and screaming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my knee I dropped and shot him, shot
Rogers when he stopped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell back as the scream died in his throat.</p>
<p>The Bishop began the words of the Absolution.
Some whisper of the well-remembered sound must
have reached down to the soul of Rafe Gadbeau
in its dark place, for, as though unconsciously,
his lips began to form the words of the Act of
Contrition.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>As the Bishop finished, the tremor of death ran
through the body in his arms. He knelt there
holding the empty shell of a man.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing, standing a little distance away,
resting against the flank of her horse, had time to
be awed and subdued by the terrific forces of this
world and the other that were at work about her.
This world, with the exception of this little island
on which she stood, was on fire. The wind had
almost entirely died out. On every side the flames
rose evenly to the very heavens. Direction, distance,
place, all were blotted out. There was no
east, no west; no north, no south. Only an impenetrable
ring of fire, no earth, no sky. Only
these few bare rocks and this inverted bowl of
lurid, hot, cinder-laden air out of which she must
get the breath of life.</p>
<p>Into this ring of fire a hunted man had burst,
just as she had seen a rabbit and a belated woodchuck
bursting. And that man had lain himself
down to die. And here, of all places, he had
found the hand of the mighty, the omnipresent
Catholic Church reached out ready to him!</p>
<p>She was only a young girl. But since that night
when the Bishop had come to her as she held her
father dying in her arms she had thought much.
Thought had been pressed upon her. Forces had
pressed themselves in upon her mind. The things
that she had been hearing and reading since her
childhood, the thoughts of the people among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
whom she had grown up, the feeling of loyalty to
her own kind, all these had fought in her against
the dominion of the Catholic Church which challenged
them all.</p>
<p>Because she had so recently come under its influence,
the Catholic Church seemed ever to be unfolding
new wonders to her. It seemed as though
she stepped ever from one holy of holies into another
more wonderful, more awesome. Yet always
there seemed to be something just beyond,
some deeper, more mysterious meaning to which
she could not quite attain. Always a door opened,
only to disclose another closed door beyond it.</p>
<p>Here surely she stood as near to naked truth
as it was possible to get. Here were none of the
forms of words, none of the explanations, none
of the ready-made answers of the catechism.
Here were just two men. One was a bad man,
a man of evil life. He was dying. In a few moments
his soul must go&ndash;&ndash;somewhere. The other
was a good man. To-day he had risked his life
to save the lives of this man and others&ndash;&ndash;for
Ruth was quick to suspect that Gadbeau had been
caught in the fire because other men were chasing
him.</p>
<p>Now these two men had a question to settle between
them. In a very few minutes these two
men must settle whether this bad man&rsquo;s soul was
presently going to Hell or to Heaven for all eternity.
You see, she was a very direct young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
person. She took her religion at its word,
straight in the eyes, literally.</p>
<p>So far she had not needed to take any precautions
against hearing anything that was said. The
dull roar of the fire all about them effectually
silenced every other sound. Then, without warning,
high above the noise of the fire, came the
shrill, breaking voice of Gadbeau, screaming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my knee I dropped and shot him, shot
Rogers as he stopped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily she turned and started towards
the men. Gadbeau had fallen back in the
Bishop&rsquo;s arms and the Bishop was leaning over,
apparently talking to him. She knew that she
must not go near until the Bishop gave her leave.
She turned back and putting her hands up to her
ears buried her face in Brom Bones&rsquo; mane.</p>
<p>But she could not put away the words that she
had heard. Never, so long as she lived, was she
able to forget them. Like the flash of the shot
itself, they leaped to her brain and seared themselves
there. Years afterwards she could shut
her eyes and fairly see those words burning in her
mind.</p>
<p>When it was ended, the Bishop called to her and
she went over timidly. She heard the Bishop say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone. Will you say a prayer, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Bishop began to read slowly, in the
light of the flames, the Prayers for the Departed.
Ruth kneeling drew forth her beads and among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
the Mysteries she wept gently&ndash;&ndash;why, she knew
not.</p>
<p>When the Bishop had finished, he knelt a while
in silence, looking into the face of the dead.
Then he arose and folded the long arms on the
tattered breast and straightened the body.</p>
<p>Ruth rose and watched him in a troubled way.
Once, twice she opened her lips to speak. But
she did not know what to say or how to say it.
Finally she began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bishop, I&ndash;&ndash;I heard&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child. You heard nothing,&rdquo; the Bishop
interrupted quietly, &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth understood. And for a little space the
two stood there looking down. The dead man&rsquo;s
secret lay between them, buried under God&rsquo;s awful
seal.</p>
<p>The Bishop went to his horse and unstrapping
Father Brady&rsquo;s storm coat which he had brought
wrapped it gently over the head and body of the
dead man as a protection from the showers of
glowing cinders that rained down upon everything.</p>
<p>Then they took up the interminable vigil of the
night, standing at their horses&rsquo; heads, their faces
buried in the manes, their arms thrown over the
horses&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>As the night wore on the fire, having consumed
everything to the east and south, moved on deliberately
into the west and north. But the sharp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
acrid smoke of trees left smouldering behind still
kept them in exquisite, blinded torture.</p>
<p>The murky, grey pall of the night turned almost
to black as the fires to the east died almost out in
that last, lifeless hour of the night. The light
of the morning showed a faint, sickly white
through the smoke banks on the high hills. When
it was time for the sun to be rising over Bald
Mountain, the morning breezes came down lifting
the heavy clouds of smoke and carrying them overhead
and away into the west. They saw the
world again, a grey, ash-strewn world, with not a
land-mark left but the bare knobs of the hills and
here and there a great tree still standing smoking
like a burnt-out torch.</p>
<p>They mounted wearily, and taking a last look at
the figure of the man lying there on his rocky
bier, picked their way down to the sloping hillside.
The Gaunt Rocks had saved their lives.
Now they must reach Little Tupper and water if
they would have their horses live. Intolerable,
frightful thirst was already swelling their own
lips and they knew that the plight of the horses
was inevitably worse.</p>
<p>Ruth took the lead, for she knew the country.
They must travel circuitously, avoiding the places
that had been wooded for the fallen trees would
still be burning and would block them everywhere.
The road was impossible because it had
largely run through wooded places and the trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
would have fallen across it. Their situation was
not desperate, but at any moment a horse might
drop or turn mad for water.</p>
<p>For two hours they plodded steadily over the
hills through the hot, loose-lying ashes. In all the
world it seemed that not man nor beast nor bird
was alive. The top of the earth was one grey
ruin, draped with the little sworls of dust and
ashes that the playful wind sent drifting up into
their mouths and eyes.</p>
<p>They dared not ride faster than a walk, for the
ashes had blown level over holes and traps of all
sorts in which a galloping horse would surely break
his leg. Nor would it have been safe to put the
horses to any rapid expenditure of energy. The
little that was left in them must be doled out to the
very last ounce. For they did not yet know what
lay between them and French Village and the lake.
If the fire had not reached the lake during the
night then it was always a possibility that, with
this fresh morning wind, a new fire might spring
up from the ashes of the old and place an impassable
barrier between them and the water.</p>
<p>When this thought came to them, as it must,
they involuntarily quickened their pace. The impulse
was to make one wild dash for the lake.
But they knew that it would be nothing short of
madness. They must go slowly and carefully, enduring
the torture with what fortitude they could.</p>
<p>The story which the Bishop had heard from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
lips of the dying man had stirred him profoundly.
He now knew definitely, what yesterday he had
suspected, that men had been sent into the hills
by the railroad people to set fire to the forests,
thereby driving the people out of that part of the
country which the railroad wished to possess. He
was moved to anger by the knowledge, but he
knew that he must try to drive that knowledge
back into the deepest recess of his mind; must try
to hide it even from himself, lest in some unguarded
moment, some time of stress and mental
conflict, he should by word or look, by a gesture
or even by an omission, reveal even his consciousness
of that knowledge. Now he knew that
the situation which last night he had thought to
meet in French Village would almost certainly
confront him there this morning, if indeed he ever
succeeded in reaching there. And he must be
doubly on his guard lest the things which he might
learn to-day should in his mind confuse themselves
with what he had last night learned under the seal
of the confessional.</p>
<p>Through all the night Ruth Lansing had been
hearing the words of that last cry of the dying
man. She did not know how near they came to
her. She did not know that Jeffrey Whiting had
stood with his gun levelled upon the man whom
Gadbeau had killed. But, try as she would to
keep back the knowledge which she knew she must
never under any circumstances reveal, those words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
came ringing upon her ears. And she knew that
the secret would haunt her and taunt her always.</p>
<p>As they came over the last of the ridges, the
grey waste of the country sloping from all sides to
the lake lay open before them. There was not a
ruin, not a standing stick to show them where
little French Village had once stood along the
lake. The fire had gone completely around the
lake to the very water edge and a back draught
had drawn it up in a circle around the east slope.
There it had burned itself out along the forest
line of the higher hills. It had gone on toward
the west, burning its way down to the settled farm
lands. But there would be no more fire in this
region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the people make their way down the
river,&rdquo; the Bishop asked; &ldquo;or did they escape back
into the higher hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they did either,&rdquo; Ruth answered
as she scanned the lake sharply. &ldquo;There is something
out there in the middle of the lake, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they made rafts out of the
logs and went through the fire that way. They&rsquo;d
be better off than we were, and that way they
could save some things. If they had run away
they would have had to drop everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses, sniffing the moist air from the lake,
pricked up their ears and started briskly down the
slope. It was soon plain that Ruth was right in
her conjecture. They could now make out five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
or six large rafts which the people had evidently
thrown together out of the logs that had been
lying in the lake awaiting their turn at the sawmill.
These were crowded with people, standing
as they must have stood all through the night;
and now the freshening wind, aided by such help
as the people could give it with boards and poles,
was moving all slowly toward the shore where
their homes had been.</p>
<p>The heart of the Shepherd was very low as he
rode fetlock deep through the ashes of what had
been the street of a happy little village and
watched his people coming sadly back to land.
There was nothing for them to come back to.
They might as well have gone to the other side
of the lake to begin life again. But they would
inevitably, with that dumb loyalty to places, which
people share with birds, come back and begin
their nests over again.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour they stood on the little
beach, letting the horses drink a little now and
then, and watching the approach of the rafts.
When they came to the shallow water, men and
boys jumped yelling from the rafts and came wading
ashore. In a few moments the rafts were
emptied of all except the very aged or the crippled
who must be carried off.</p>
<p>They crowded around the grimy, unrecognisable
Bishop and the girl with wonder and a little
superstition, for it was plain that these two people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
must have come straight through the fire. But
when Father Ponfret came running forward and
knelt at the Bishop&rsquo;s feet, a great glad cry of
wondering recognition went up from all the French
people. It was their Bishop! He who spoke
the French of the most astonishing! His coming
was a sign! A deliverance! They had come
through horrors. Now all was well! The good
God had hidden His face through the long night.
Now, in the morning He had sent His messenger
to say that all was well!</p>
<p>Laughing and crying in the quick surcharge of
spirits that makes their race what it is, they threw
themselves on their knees begging his blessing.
The Bishop bared his head and raised his hand
slowly. He was infinitely humbled by the quick,
spontaneous outburst of their faith. He had done
nothing for them; could do nothing for them.
They were homeless, pitiable, without a hope or a
stick of shelter. Yet it had needed but the sight
of his face to bring out their cheery unbounded
confidence that God was good, that the world was
right again.</p>
<p>The other people, the hill people of the Bishop&rsquo;s
own blood and race, stood apart. They did not
understand the scene. They were not a kind of
people that could weep and laugh at once. But
they were not unmoved. For years they had
heard of the White Horse Chaplain. Some two
or three old men of them saw him now through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
a mist of memory and battle smoke riding a mad
horse across a field. They knew that this was the
man. That he should appear out of the fire after
the nightmare through which they had passed was
not so much incredible as it was a part of the
strange things that they had always half believed
about him.</p>
<p>Then rose the swift, shrill cackle of tongues
around the Bishop. Father Ponfret, a quick,
eager little man of his people, would drag the
Bishop&rsquo;s story from him by very force. Had he
dropped from Heaven? How had he come to be
in the hills? Had a miracle saved him from the
fire?</p>
<p>The Bishop told the tale simply, accenting the
folly of his own imprudence, and how he had been
saved from the consequences of it by the quickness
and wisdom of the young girl. Father Ponfret
translated freely and with a fine flourish.
Then the Bishop told of the coming of Rafe Gadbeau
and how the man had died with the Sacrament.
They nodded their heads in silence.
There was nothing to be said. They knew who
the man was. He had done wickedly. But the
good God had stretched out the wing of His great
Church over him at the last. Why say more?
God was good. No?</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing went among her own hill people,
grouped on the outskirts of the crowd that pressed
around the Bishop, answering their eager questions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
and asking questions of her own. There was just
one question that she wanted to ask, but something
kept it back from her lips. There was no reason
at all why she should not ask them about Jeffrey
Whiting. Some of them must at least have heard
news of him, must know in what direction he had
gone to fight the fire. But some unnamed dread
seemed to take possession of her so that she dared
not put her crying question into words.</p>
<p>Some one at her elbow, who had heard what
the French people were saying, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that was Gadbeau that crawled
out of the fire and died, Miss Lansing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I knew him well, of course. It was
Gadbeau, certainly,&rdquo; Ruth answered without looking
up.</p>
<p>Then a tall young fellow in front of her said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s two of &rsquo;em done for. That was
Gadbeau. And Jeff Whiting shot Rogers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not!&rdquo; Ruth blazed up in the young
man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Jeffrey Whiting did <i>not</i> shoot Rogers!
Rafe&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horror of the thing she had been about to
do rushed upon her and blinded her. The blood
came rushing up into her throat and brain, choking
her, stunning her, so that she gasped and staggered.
The young man, Perry Waite, caught her
by the arm as she seemed about to fall. She
struggled a moment for control of herself, then
managed to gasp:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing&ndash;&ndash; Let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perry Waite looked sharply into her face.
Then he took his hand from her arm.</p>
<p>Trembling and horror-stricken, Ruth slipped
away and crowded herself in among the people
who stood around the Bishop. Here no one
would be likely to speak to her. And here, too,
she felt a certain relief, a sense of security, in being
surrounded by people who would understand.
Even though they knew nothing of her secret, yet
the mere feeling that she stood among those who
could have understood gave her strength and a
feeling of safety even against herself which she
could not have had among her own kind.</p>
<p>But she was not long left with her feeling of
security. A wan, grey-faced girl with burning
eyes caught Ruth fiercely by the arm and drew her
out of the crowd. It was Cynthe Cardinal,
though Ruth found it difficult to recognise in her
the red-cheeked, sprightly French girl she had met
in the early summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw Rafe Gadbeau die,&rdquo; the girl said
roughly, as she faced Ruth sharply at a little distance
from the crowd. &ldquo;You were there, close?
No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the fire was all around,&rdquo; Ruth answered,
quaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he die? Tell me. How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;why, he died quickly, in the Bishop&rsquo;s
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Yes. But how? He <i>confessed</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;he went to confession, you mean.
Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl was not to be evaded in that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;I heard
M&rsquo;sieur the Bishop. But did he <i>confess</i>&ndash;&ndash;about
Rogers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Cynthe, you must be crazy. You know
I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. I couldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say nothing, except in confession?&rdquo;
the girl questioned swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; Ruth answered, relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you heard?&rdquo; the girl returned shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Cynthe, I heard nothing. You know
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are lying,&rdquo; Cynthe said slowly.
&ldquo;That is right. But I do not know. Will you
always be able to lie? I do not know. You are
Catholic, yes. But you are new. You are not
like one of us. Sometime you will forget. It is
not bred in the bone of you as it is bred in us.
Sometime when you are not thinking some one will
ask you a question and you will start and your
tongue will slip, or you will be silent&ndash;&ndash;and that
will be just as bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth stood looking down at the ground. She
dared not speak, did not even raise her eyes, for
any assurance of silence or even a reassuring look
to the girl would be an admission that she must not
make.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Swear it in your heart! Swear that you did
not hear a word! You cannot speak to me. But
swear it to your soul,&rdquo; said the girl in a low, tense
whisper; &ldquo;swear that you will never, sleeping or
waking, laughing or crying, in joy or in sorrow, let
woman or man know that you heard. Swear it.
And while you swear, remember.&rdquo; She drew
Ruth close to her and almost hissed into her ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember&ndash;&ndash; You love Jeffrey Whiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped Ruth&rsquo;s arm and turned quickly
away.</p>
<p>Ruth stood there trembling weakly, her mind
lost in a whirl of fright and bewilderment. She
did not know where to turn. She could not grapple
with the racing thoughts that went hurtling
through her mind.</p>
<p>This girl had loved Rafe Gadbeau. She was
half crazed with her love and her grief. And she
was determined to protect his name from the dark
blot of murder. With the uncanny insight that is
sometimes given to those beside themselves with
some great grief or strain, the girl had seen Ruth&rsquo;s
terrible secret bare in its hiding place and had
plucked it out before Ruth&rsquo;s very eyes.</p>
<p>The awful, the unbelievable thing had happened,
thought Ruth. She had broken the seal of
the confessional! She had been entrusted with
the most terrible secret that a man could have to
tell, under the most awful bond that God could put
upon a secret. And the secret had escaped her!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>She had said no word at all. But, just as surely
as if she had repeated the cry of the dying man in
the night, Ruth knew that the other girl had taken
her secret from her.</p>
<p>And with that same uncanny insight, too, the
girl had looked into the future and had shown
Ruth what a burden the secret was to be to her.
Nay, what a burden it was already becoming.
For already she was afraid to speak to any one,
afraid to go near any person that she had ever
known.</p>
<p>And that girl had stripped bare another of
Ruth&rsquo;s secrets, one that had been hidden even
from herself. She had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember&ndash;&ndash; You love Jeffrey Whiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ways, she had always loved him. But she
now realised that she had never known what love
was. Now she knew. She had seen it flame up
in the eyes of the half mad French girl, ready to
clutch and tear for the dead name of the man
whom she had loved. Now Ruth knew what it
was, and it came burning up in her heart to protect
the dear name of her own beloved one, her man.
Already men were putting the brand of Cain upon
him! Already the word was running from mouth
to mouth over the hills&ndash;&ndash; The word of blood!
And with it ran the name of her love! Jeffrey,
the boy she had loved since always, the man she
would love forever!</p>
<p>He would hear it from other mouths. But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
oh! the cruel, unbearable taunt was that only two
days ago he had heard it first from her own lips!
Why? Why? How? How had she ever said
such a thing? Ever thought of such a thing?</p>
<p>But she could not speak as the French girl had
spoken for her man. She could not swear the
mouths to silence. She could not cry out the
bursting, torturing truth that alone would close
those mouths. No, not even to Jeffrey himself
could she ever by word, or even by the faintest
whisper, or even by a look, show that she knew
more than his and other living mouths could tell
her! Never would she be able to look into his
eyes and say:</p>
<p>I <i>know</i> you did not do it.</p>
<p>Only in her most secret heart of hearts could
she be glad that she knew. And even that knowledge
was the sacred property of the dead man.
It was not hers. She must try to keep it out of
her mind. Love, horror, and the awful weight of
God&rsquo;s seal pressed in upon her to crush her.
There was no way to turn, no step to take. She
could not meet them, could not cope with them.</p>
<p>Stumbling blindly, she crept out of the crowd
and down to where Brom Bones stood by the lake.
There the kindly French women found her, her
face buried in the colt&rsquo;s mane, crying hysterically.
They bathed her hands and face and soothed her,
and when she was a little quieted they gave her
drink and food. And Ruth, reviving, and knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
that she would need strength above all things,
took what was given and silently faced the galling
weight of the burden that was hers.</p>
<p>The Bishop had taken quick charge of the whole
situation. The first thing to be decided was
whether the people should try to hold out where
they were or should attempt at once to walk out
to the villages on the north or west. To the west
it would mean forty miles of walking over ashes
with hardly any way of carrying water. To the
north it would mean a longer walk, but they could
follow the river and have water at hand. The
danger in that direction was that they might come
into the path of a new fire that would cut them
off from all help.</p>
<p>Even if they did come out safe to the villages,
what would they do there? They would be scattered,
penniless, homeless. There was nothing
left for them here but the places where their
homes had been, but at least they would be together.
The cataclysm through which they had
all passed, which had brought the prosperous and
the poverty-stricken alike to the common level of
just a few meals away from starvation, would here
bind them together and give them a common
strength for a new grip on life. If there was
food enough to carry them over the four or five
days that would be required to get supplies up
from Lowville or from the head of the new railroad,
then they should stay here.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>The Bishop went swiftly among them, where
already mothers were drawing family groups aside
and parcelling out the doles of food. Already
these mothers were erecting the invisible roof-tree
and drawing around them and theirs the circle of
the hearth, even though it was a circle drawn only
in hot, drifting ashes. The Bishop was an inquisitor
kindly of eye and understanding of heart,
but by no means to be evaded. Unsuspected
stores of bread and beans and tinned meats came
forth from nondescript bundles of clothing and
were laid under his eye. It appeared that Arsene
LaComb had stayed in his little provision store
until the last moment portioning out what was his
with even hand, to each one as much as could be
carried. The Bishop saw that it was all pitifully
little for those who had lived in the village and
for those refugees who had been driven in from
the surrounding hills. But, he thought, it would
do. These were people born to frugality, inured
to scanty living.</p>
<p>The thing now was to give them work for their
hands, to put something before them that was to
be accomplished. For even in the ruin of all
things it is not well for men to sit down in the
ashes and merely wait. They had no tools left
but the axes which they had carried in their hands
to the rafts, but with these they could hew some
sort of shelter out of the loose logs in the lake.
A rough shack of any kind would cover at least
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
the weaker ones until lumber could be brought up
or until a saw could be had for the ruined mill at
the outlet of the lake. It would be slow work and
hard and a makeshift at the best. But it would
put heart into them to see at least something, anything,
begin to rise from the hopeless level of the
ashes.</p>
<p>Three of the hill men had managed to keep
their horses by holding desperately to them all
through the day before and swimming and wading
them through the night in the lake. These
the Bishop despatched to what, as near as he could
judge, were the nearest points from which messages
could be gotten to the world outside the
burnt district. They bore orders to dealers in the
nearest towns for all the things that were immediately
necessary for the life and rebuilding of the
little village. With the orders went the notes of
hand of all the men gathered here who had had
a standing of credit or whose names would mean
anything to the dealers. And, since the world
outside would well know that these men had now
nothing that would make the notes worth while,
each note bore the endorsement of the Bishop of
Alden. For the Bishop knew that there was no
time to wait for charity and its tardy relief.
Credit, that intangible, indefinable thing that alone
makes the life of the world go on, must be established
at once. And it was characteristic of
Joseph Winthrop that, in endorsing the notes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
penniless, broken men, he did not feel that he
was signing obligations upon himself and his diocese.
He was simply writing down his gospel
of his unbounded, unafraid faith in all true men.
And it is a commentary upon that faith of his that
he was never presented with a single one of the
notes he signed that day.</p>
<p>All the day long men toiled with heart and will,
dragging logs and driftwood from the lake and
cutting, splitting, shaping planks and joists for a
shanty, while the women picked burnt nails and
spikes from the ruins of what had been their
homes. So that when night came down over the
hills there was an actual shelter over the heads of
women and children. And the light spirited,
sanguine people raised cheer after cheer as their
imagination leaped ahead to the new French Village
that would rise glorious out of the ashes of
the old. Then Father Ponfret, catching their
mood, raised for them the hymn to the Good
Saint Anne. They were all men from below
Beaupre and from far Chicothomi where the Good
Saint holds the hearts of all. That hymn had
never been out of their childhood hearing. They
sang it now, old and young, good and bad, their
eyes filling with the quick-welling tears, their
hearts rising high in hope and love and confidence
on the lilt of the air. Even the Bishop, whose
singing voice approached a scandal and whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
French has been spoken of before, joined in loud
and unashamed.</p>
<p>Then mothers clucking softly to their offspring
in the twilight brooded them in to shelter
from the night damp of the lake, and men, sharing
odd pieces and wisps of tobacco, lay down to
talk and plan and dropped dead asleep with the
hot pipes still clenched in their teeth.</p>
<p>Also, a bishop, a very tired, weary man, a very
old man to-night, laid his head upon a saddle and
a folded blanket and considered the Mysteries of
God and His world, as the beads slipped through
his fingers and unfolded their story to him.</p>
<p>Two men were stumbling fearfully down
through the ashes of the far slope to the lake.
All day long they had lain on their faces in the
grass just beyond the highest line of the fire. The
fire had gone on past them leaving them safe.
But behind them rose tier upon tier of barren
rocks, and behind those lay a hundred miles nearly
of unknown country. They could not go that
way. They were not, in fact, fit for travel in any
direction. For all the day before they had run,
dodging like hunted rats, between a line of fire&ndash;&ndash;of
their own making&ndash;&ndash;before them, and a line of
armed men behind them. They had outrun the
fire and gotten beyond its edge. They had outrun
the men and escaped them. They were free
of those two enemies. But a third enemy had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
run with them all through the day yesterday and
had stayed with them through all the horror of
last night and it had lain with them through all the
blistering heat of to-day, thirst. Thirst, intolerable,
scorching thirst, drying their bones, splitting
their lips, bulging their eyes. And all day long,
down there before their very eyes, taunting them,
torturing them by its nearness, lay a lake cool and
sweet and deep and wide. It was worse than the
mirage of any desert, for they knew that it was
real. It was not merely the illusion of the sense
of sight. They could perhaps have stood the torture
of one sense. But this lake came up to them
through all their senses. They could feel the air
from it cool upon their brows. The wind brought
the smell of water up to taunt their nostrils.
And, so near did it seem, they could even fancy
that they heard the lapping of the little waves
against the rocks. This last they knew was an
illusion. But, for the matter of that, all might
as well have been an illusion. Armed men, their
enemies who had yesterday chased them with
death in their hearts, were scattered around the
shore of the lake, alert and watching for any one
who might come out of the fringe of shrub and
grass beyond the line of the burnt ground. No
living thing could move down that bare and
whitened hillside toward the lake without being
marked by those armed men. And, for these two
men, to be seen meant to die.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>So they had lain all day on their faces and raved
in their torture. Now when they saw the fires on
the shore where French Village had been beginning
to die down they were stumbling painfully
and crazily down to the water.</p>
<p>They threw themselves down heavily in the
burnt grass at the edge of the lake and drank
greedily, feverishly until they could drink no
more. Then they rolled back dizzily upon the
grass and rested until they could return to drink.
When they had fully slaked their thirst and rested
to let the nausea of weakness pass from them they
realised now that thirst was not the only thing in
the world. It had taken up so much of their recent
thought that they had forgotten everything
else. Now a terrible and gnawing hunger came
upon them and they knew that if they would live
and travel&ndash;&ndash;and they must travel&ndash;&ndash;they would
have to have food at once.</p>
<p>Over there at the end of the lake where the
cooking fires had now died out there were men
lying down to sleep with full stomachs. There
was food over there, food in plenty, food to be
had for the taking! Now it did not seem that
thirst was so terrible, nor were armed men any
great thing to be feared. Hunger was the only
real enemy. Food was the one thing that they
must have, before all else and in spite of all else.
They would go over there and take the food in
the face of all the world!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>Brom Bones was hobbled down by the water
side picking drowsily at a few wisps of half-burnt
grass and sniffing discontentedly to himself.
There was a great deal wrong with the world.
He had not, it seemed, seen a spear of fresh grass
for an age. And as for oats, he did not remember
when he had had any. It was true that Ruth
had dug up some baked potatoes out of a field for
him and he had been glad to eat them, but&ndash;&ndash;Fresh
grass! Or oats!</p>
<p>Just then he felt a strange hand slipping his
hobbles. It was nothing to be alarmed at, of
course. But he did not like strange hands around
him. He let fly a swift kick into the dark, and
thought no more of the matter.</p>
<p>A few moments later a man went running softly
toward the horse. He carried a bundle of tinned
meats and preserves slung in a coat. At peril of
his life he had crept up and stolen them from the
common pile that was stacked up at the very door
of the shanty where the women and children
slept. As he came running he grabbed for Brom
Bones&rsquo; bridle and tried to launch himself across
the colt&rsquo;s back. In his leap a can of meat fell and
a sharp corner of it struck and cut deep into Brom
Bones&rsquo; hock. The colt squealed and leaped aside.</p>
<p>A man sprang up from the side of a fire, gripping
a rifle and kicking the embers into a blaze.
He saw the man struggling with the horse and
fired. The colt with one unearthly scream of terror
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
leaped and plunged head down towards the
water, shot dead through his stout, faithful
heart.</p>
<p>In a moment twenty men were running into the
dark, shouting and shooting at everything that
seemed to move, while the women and children
screamed and wailed their fright within the little
building.</p>
<p>The two men running with the food for which
they had been willing to give their lives dropped
flat on the ground unhurt. The pursuing men
running wildly stumbled over them. They were
quickly secured and hustled and kicked to their
feet and brought back to the fire.</p>
<p>They must die. And they must die now.
They were in the hands of men whose homes they
had burned, whose dear ones they had menaced
with the most terrible of deaths; men who for
thirty-six hours now had been thirsting to kill
them. The hour had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them down to the gully. Build a fire
and dig their graves.&rdquo; Old Erskine Beasley
spoke the sentence.</p>
<p>A short, sharp cry of satisfaction was the answer.
A cry that suggested the snapping of jaws
let loose upon the prey.</p>
<p>Then Joseph Winthrop stood in the very midst
of the crowd, laying hands upon the two cowering
men, and spoke. A moment before he had
caught his heart saying: This is justice, let it be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
done. But he had cried to God against the sin
that had whispered at his heart, and he spoke now
calmly, as one assured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we do wisely, men?&rdquo; he questioned.
&ldquo;These men are guilty. We know that, for you
saw them almost in the act. The sentence is just,
for they planned what might have been death for
you and yours. But shall only these two be punished?
Are there not others? And if we silence
these two now forever, how shall we be ever able
to find the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be sure of these two,&rdquo; said a sullen
voice in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned the Bishop, raising his voice.
&ldquo;But I tell you there are others greater than any
of these who have come into the hills risking their
lives. How shall we find and punish those other
greater ones? And I tell you further there is one,
for it is always one in the end. I tell you there is
one man walking the world to-night without a
thought of danger or disgrace from whose single
mind came all this trouble upon us. That one
man we must find. And I pledge you, my friends
and my neighbours,&rdquo; he went on raising his hand,
&ldquo;I pledge you that that one man will be found
and that he will do right by you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before these men die, bring a justice&ndash;&ndash;there
is one of the village&ndash;&ndash;and let them confess before
the world and to him on paper what they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
know of this crime and of those who commanded
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grudging silence was the only answer, but the
Bishop had won for the time. Old Toussaint
Derossier, the village justice, was brought forward,
fumbling with his beloved wallet of papers,
and made to sit upon an up-turned bucket with a
slab across his knee and write in his long hand of
the <i>rue Henri</i> the story that the men told.</p>
<p>They were ready to tell. They were eager to
spin out every detail of all they knew for they felt
that men stood around them impatient for the
ending of the story, that they might go on with
their task.</p>
<p>The Bishop knew that the real struggle was yet
to come. He must save these men, not only because
it was his duty as a citizen and a Christian
and a priest, but because he foresaw that his
friend, Jeffrey Whiting, might one day be accused
of the killing of a certain man, and that these
men might in that day be able to tell something of
that story which he himself could but must not
tell.</p>
<p>The temper of the crowd was perhaps running
a little lower when the story of the men was
finished. But the Bishop was by no means sure
that he could hold them back from their purpose.
Nevertheless he spoke simply and with a determination
that was not to be mistaken. At the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
first move of the leaders of the hill men to carry
out their intention, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men, you shall not do this thing. Shall
not, I say. Shall not. I will prevent. I will
put this old body of mine between. You shall
not move these men from this spot. And if they
are shot, then the bullets must pass through me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will call this thing justice. But you know
in your hearts it is just one thing&ndash;&ndash;Revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo; came an angry
voice out of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>not</i> my business,&rdquo; said the Bishop solemnly.
&ldquo;It is the business of God. Of your
God. Of my God. Am I a meddling priest?
Have I no right to speak God&rsquo;s name to you, because
we do not believe all the same things? My
business is with the souls of men&ndash;&ndash;of all men.
And never in my life have I so attended to my own
business as I am doing this minute, when I say to
you in the name of God, of the God of my fathers
and your fathers, do not put this sin of murder
upon your souls this night. Have you wives?
Have you mothers? Have you sweethearts?
Can you go back to them with blood upon your
hands and say: A man warned us, but he had no
<i>business</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bind these men, I say. Hold them. Fear
not. Justice shall be done. And you will see
right in the end. As you believe in your God,
oh! believe me now! You shall see right!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>The Bishop stopped. He had won. He saw
it in the faces of the men about him. God had
spoken to their hearts, he saw, even through his
feeble and unthought words. He saw it and was
glad.</p>
<p>He saw the men bound. Saw a guard put over
them.</p>
<p>Then he went down near to the lake where a
girl kneeling beside her dead pet wept wildly.
The proud-standing, stout-hearted horse had done
his noble part in saving the life of Joseph
Winthrop, Bishop of Alden. But that Bishop of
Alden, that mover of men, that man of powerful
words, had now no word that he could dare to
say in comfort to this grief.</p>
<p>He covered his face and turned, walking away
through the ashes into the dark. And as he
walked, fingering his beads, he again considered
the things of God and His world.</p>

<h3>THE INNER CITADEL</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, gentlemen of this jury, I propose to
prove to your absolute satisfaction that this defendant,
Jeffrey Whiting, did wilfully and with
prepared design, murder Samuel Rogers on the
morning of August twentieth last. I shall not
only prove to you the existence of a long-standing
hatred harboured by this defendant against the
murdered man, but I will show to you a direct motive
for the crime. And I shall not only prove
circumstantially to you that he and no other could
have done the deed but I shall also convict him out
of the unwilling mouths of his friends and neighbours
who were, to all intents and purposes, actual
eye-witnesses of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the red sandstone courthouse of Racquette
County the District Attorney of the county was
opening the case for the State against Jeffrey
Whiting, charged with the murder of Samuel Rogers,
who had died by the hand of Rafe Gadbeau
that grim morning on the side of Bald Mountain.</p>
<p>From early morning the streets of Danton, the
little county seat of Racquette County, had been
filled with the wagons and horses of the hill people
who had come down for this, the second day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
of the trial. Yesterday the jury had been selected.
They were all men of the villages and of
the one little city of Racquette County, men whose
lives or property had never been endangered by
forest fires. Judge Leslie in questioning them and
in ruling their selection had made it plain that the
circumstances surrounding the killing of the man
Rogers must have no weight in their minds.
They must be prepared to judge the guilt or innocence
of the prisoner purely on the charge of murder
itself, with no regard for what rumour might
say the victim had been doing at the time.</p>
<p>For the prisoner, it seemed unfortunate that the
man had been killed just a mile or so within the
line of Racquette County. Only a little of the extreme
southeastern corner of that county had been
burned over in the recent fire and in general it had
meant very little to these people. In Tupper
County where Jeffrey Whiting had lived and which
had suffered terribly from the fire it should have
been nearly impossible to select a jury which would
have been willing to convict the slayer of Rogers
under the circumstances. But to the people of
the villages of Racquette County the matter did
not come home. They only knew that a man had
been killed up the corner of the county. A forest
fire had started at about the same time and place.
But few people had any clear version of the story.
And there seemed to be little doubt as to the identity
of the slayer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>There was another and far more potent reason
why it was unfortunate for Jeffrey Whiting that
Samuel Rogers had died within the lines of
Racquette County. The Judge who sat upon the
bench was the same man who only a few weeks
before had pleaded so unctuously before the Senate
committee for the rights of the downtrodden U.
&amp; M. Railroad against the lawless people of the
hills. He had given the District Attorney every
possible assistance toward the selection of a jury
who would be at least thoughtful of the interests
of the railroad. For this was not merely a murder
trial. It was the case of the people of the
hills against the U. &amp; M. Railroad.</p>
<p>Racquette County was a &ldquo;railroad&rdquo; county.
The life of every one of its rising villages depended
absolutely upon the good will of the railroad
system that had spread itself beneficently
over the county and that had given it a prosperity
beyond that of any other county of the North.
Racquette County owed a great deal to the railroad,
and it was not in the disposition or the plans
of the railroad to leave the county in a position
where it might forget the debt. So the railroad
saw to it that only men personally known to its
officials should have public office in the county.
It had put this judge upon this bench. And the
railroad was no niggard to its servants. It paid
him well for the very timely and valuable services
which he was able to render it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>The grip which the railroad corporation had
upon the life of Racquette County was so complex
and varied that it extended to every money-making
affair in the community. It was an intangible
but impenetrable mesh of interests and influences
that extended in every direction and crossed and
intercrossed so that no man could tell where it
ended. But all men could surely tell that these
lines of influence ran from all ends of the county
into the hand of the attorney for the railroad in
Alden and that from his hand they passed on into
the hands of the single great man in New York
whose money and brain dominated the whole
transportation business of the State. All men
knew, too, that those lines passed through the
Capitol at Albany and that no man there, from
the Executive down to the youngest page in the
legislative corridors, was entirely immune from
their influence.</p>
<p>Now the U. &amp; M. Railroad had been openly
charged with having procured the setting of the
fire that had left five hundred hill people homeless
in Tupper and Adirondack Counties. It would,
of course, be impossible to bring the railroad to
trial on such a charge in any county of the State.
The company had really nothing to fear in the way
of criminal prosecution. But the matter had
touched the temper and roused the suspicions of
the great, headless body called the public. The
railroad felt that it must not be silent under even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
a muttered and vague charge of such nature. It
must strike first, and in a spectacular manner. It
must divert the public mind by a counter charge.</p>
<p>Before the rain had come down to wet the ashes
of the fire, the Grand Jury of Racquette County
had been prepared to find an indictment against
Jeffrey Whiting for the murder of Samuel Rogers.
They had found that Samuel Rogers was an agent
of the railroad engaged upon a peaceable and lawful
journey through the hills in the interests of his
company. He had been found shot through the
back of the head and the circumstances surrounding
his death were of such a nature and disposition
as to warrant the finding of a bill against the
young man who for months had been leading a
stubborn fight against the railroad.</p>
<p>The case had been advanced over all others on
the calendar in Judge Leslie&rsquo;s court, for the railroad
was determined to occupy the mind of the
public with this case until the people should have
had time to forget the sensation of the fire. The
mind at the head of the railroad&rsquo;s affairs argued
that the mind of the public could hold only one
thing at a time. Therefore it was better to put
this murder case into that mind and keep it there
until some new thing should arise.</p>
<p>The celerity with which Jeffrey Whiting had
been brought to trial; the well-oiled smoothness
with which the machinery of the Grand Jury had
done its work, and the efficient way in which judge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
and prosecuting attorney had worked together for
the selection of what was patently a &ldquo;railroad&rdquo;
jury, were all evidence that a strong and confident
power was moving its forces to an assured and
definite end. This judge and this jury would
allow no confusion of circumstances to stand in
the way of a clear-cut verdict. The fact that the
man had been caught in the act of setting fire to the
forests, if the Judge allowed it to appear in the
record at all, would not stand with the jury as
justification, or even extenuation of the deed of
murder charged. The fate of the accused must
hang solely on the question of fact, whether or
not his hand had fired the fatal shot. No other
question would be allowed to enter.</p>
<p>And on that question it seemed that the minds
of all men were already made up. The prisoner&rsquo;s
friends and associates in the hills had been at first
loud in their commendation of the act which they
had no doubt was his. Now, though they talked
less and less, they still did not deny their belief.
It was known that they had congratulated him on
the very scene of the murder. What room was
there in the mind of any one for doubt as to the
actual facts of the killing? And since his conviction
or acquittal must hinge on that single question,
what room was there to hope for his acquittal?</p>
<p>The hill people had come down from their
ruined homes, where they had been working night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
and day to put a roof over their families before
the cold should come. They were bitter and sullen
and nervous. They had no doubt whatever
that Jeffrey Whiting had killed the man, and they
had been forced to come down here to tell what
they knew&ndash;&ndash;every word of which would count
against them. They had come down determined
that he should not suffer for his act, which had
been done, as it were, in the name of all of them.
But the rapid certainty in which the machinery
of the law moved on toward its sacrifice unnerved
them. There was nothing for them to do, it
seemed, but to sit there, idle and glum, waiting
for the end.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting sat listening stolidly to the
opening arraignment by the District Attorney.
He was not surprised by any of it. The chain of
circumstances which had begun to wrap itself
around him that morning on Bald Mountain had
never for a moment relaxed its tightening hold
upon him. He had followed his friends that day
and all of that night and had reached Lowville
early the next day. He had found his mother
there safe and his aunt and even Cassius Bascom,
but had been horrified to learn that Ruth Lansing
had turned back into the face of the fire in an effort
to find and bring back the Bishop of Alden. No
word had been had of either of them. He had
told his mother exactly what had happened in the
hills. He had been ready to kill the man. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
had wished to do so. But another had fired before
he did. He had not, in fact, used his gun at
all. She had believed him implicitly, of course.
Why should she not? If he had actually shot the
man he would have told her that just as exactly
and truthfully. But Jeffrey was aware that she
was the only person who did or would believe him.</p>
<p>He was just on the point of mounting one of his
mother&rsquo;s horses, to go up into the lower hills in
the hope of finding Ruth wandering somewhere,
when he was placed under arrest for the murder of
Rogers. The two men who had escaped down
the line of the chain had gotten quickly to a telegraph
line and had made their report. The railroad
people had taken their decision and had acted
on the instant. The warrant was ready and waiting
for Jeffrey before he even reached Lowville.</p>
<p>When he had been taken out of his own county
and brought before the Grand Jury in Racquette
County, he realised that any hope he might have
had for a trial on the moral merits of the case was
thereby lost. Unless he could find and actually
produce that other man, whoever he was, who had
fired the shot, his own truthful story was useless.
His own friends who had been there at hand
would not believe his oath.</p>
<p>His mother and Ruth Lansing sat in court in
the front seats just to the right of him. From time
to time he turned to smile reassuringly at them
with a confidence that he was far from feeling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
His mother smiled back through glistening grey
eyes, all the while marking with a twinge at her
heart the great sharp lines that were cutting deep
into the big boyish face of her son. Mostly she
was thinking of the morning, just a few months
ago when her little boy, suddenly and unaccountably
grown to the size of a tall man, had been
obliged to lift up her face to kiss her. He was
going down into the big world, to conquer it and
bring it home for her. With that boyish forgetfulness
of everything but his own plans of conquest,
which is at once the pride and the heart-stab
of every mother with her man child, he had kissed
her and told her the old, old lie that we all have
told&ndash;&ndash;that he would be back in a little while, that
all would be the same again. And she had smiled
up into his face and had compounded the lie with
him.</p>
<p>Then in that very moment the man Rogers had
come. And the mother heart in her was not
gentle at the thought of him. He had come like
a trail of evil across their lives, embittering the
hearts of all of them. Never since she had seen
him had she slept a good night. Never had she
been able to drop asleep without a hard thought of
him. Even now, the thought of him lying in an
unhonoured grave among the ashes of the hills
could not soften her heart toward him. The
gentle, kindly heart of her was very near to hating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
even the dead as she thought of her boy brought
to this pass because of that man.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing had come twice to the county jail
in Danton with his mother to see Jeffrey. They
had not been left alone, but she had clung to him
and kissed him boldly as though by her right before
all men. The first time he had watched her
sharply, looking almost savagely to see her shrink
away from him in pity and fear of his guilt, as
he had seen men who had been his friends shrink
away from him. But there had been not a shadow
of that in Ruth, and his heart leaped now as he
remembered how she had walked unafraid into
his arms, looking him squarely and bravely in the
eyes and crying to him to forget the foolish words
that she had said to him that last day in the hills.
In that pulsing moment Jeffrey had looked into
her eyes and had seen there not the love of the
little girl that he had known but the unbounded
love and confidence of the woman who would give
herself to him for life or death. He had seen
it; the look of all the women of earth who love,
whose feet go treading in tenderness and undying
pity, whose hands are fashioned for the healing of
torn hearts.</p>
<p>It was only when she had gone, and when he in
the loneliness of his cell was reliving the hour,
that he remembered that she had scarcely listened
to his story of the morning in the hills. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
course, she had heard his story from his mother
and was probably already so familiar with it that
it had lost interest for her. But no, that was not
like Ruth. She was always a direct little person,
who wanted to know the exact how and why of
everything first hand. She would not have been
satisfied with anybody&rsquo;s telling of the matter but
his own.</p>
<p>Then a horrible suspicion leaped into his mind
and struck at his heart. Could it be that she had
over-acted it all? Could it be that she had
brushed aside his story because she really did not
believe it and could not listen to it without betraying
her doubt? And had she blinded him
with her pity? Had she acted all&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>He threw himself down on his cot and writhed
in blind despair. Might not even his mother have
deceived him! Might not she too have been acting!
What did he care now for name or liberty,
or life itself! The girl had mocked him with
what he thought was love, when it was only&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>But his good sense brought him back and set
him on his feet. Ruth was no actress. And if
she had been the greatest actress the world had
ever seen she could not have acted that flooding
love light into her eyes.</p>
<p>He threw back his head, laughing softly, and
began to pace his cell rapidly. There was some
other explanation. Either she had deliberately
put his story aside in order to keep the whole of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
their little time together entirely to themselves, or
Ruth knew something that made his story unimportant.</p>
<p>She had been through the fire herself. Both
she and the Bishop must have gone straight
through it from their home in its front line to the
rear of it at French Village. How, no one could
tell. Jeffrey had heard wild tales of the exploit&ndash;&ndash; The
French people had made many
wonders of the coming of these two to them in
the hour of their deliverance, the one the Bishop
of their souls, the other the young girl just baptised
by Holy Church and but little differing from
the angels.</p>
<p>Who could tell, thought Jeffrey, what the fire
might have revealed to one or both of these two
as they went through it. Perhaps there were
other men who had not been accounted for.
Then he remembered Rafe Gadbeau. He had
been with Rogers. He had once waylaid Jeffrey
at Rogers&rsquo; command. Might it not be that the
bullet which killed Rogers was intended for
Jeffrey himself! He must have been almost in
the line of that bullet, for Rogers had been facing
him squarely and the bullet had struck Rogers
fairly in the back of the head.</p>
<p>Or again, people had said that Rogers had possessed
some sort of mysterious hold over Rafe
Gadbeau, and that Gadbeau did his bidding unwillingly,
under a pressure of fear. What if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Gadbeau there under the excitement of the fire,
and certain that another man would be charged
with the killing, had decided that here was the
time and place to rid himself of the man who had
made him his slave!</p>
<p>The thing fascinated him, as was natural; and,
pacing his cell, stopping between mouthfuls of his
food as he sat at the jail table, sitting up in his cot
in the middle of the night to think, Jeffrey caught
at every scrap of theory and every thread of fact
that would fit into the story as it must have happened.
He wandered into many blind trails of
theory and explanation, but, strange as it was, he
at last came upon the truth&ndash;&ndash;and stuck to it.</p>
<p>Gadbeau had killed Rogers. Gadbeau had
been caught in the fire and had almost burned to
death. He had managed to reach the place where
Ruth and the Bishop had found refuge. He had
died there in their presence. He had confessed.
The Catholics always told the truth when they
were going to die. Ruth and the Bishop had
heard him. Ruth <i>knew</i>. The Bishop <i>knew</i>.</p>
<p>When Ruth came again, he watched her closely;
and saw&ndash;&ndash;just what he had expected to see.
Ruth <i>knew</i>. It was not only her love and her
confidence in him. She had none of the little whispering,
torturing doubts that must sometimes, unbidden,
rise to frighten even his mother. Ruth
<i>knew</i>.</p>
<p>That she should not tell him, or give him any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
outward hint of what she was hiding in her mind,
did not surprise him. It was a very serious matter
this with Catholics. It was a sacred matter
with anybody, to carry the secret of a dead man.
Ruth would not speak unnecessarily of it. When
the proper time came, and there was need, she
would speak. For the present&ndash;&ndash;Ruth <i>knew</i>.
That was enough.</p>
<p>When the Bishop came down from Alden to see
him, Jeffrey watched him as he had watched Ruth.
He had never been very observant. He had
never had more than a boy&rsquo;s careless indifference
and disregard of details in his way of looking at
men and things. But much thinking in the dark
had now given him intuitions that were now sharp
and sensitive as those of a woman. He was
quick to know that the grip of the Bishop&rsquo;s hand
on his, the look of the Bishop&rsquo;s eye into his, were
not those of a man who had been obliged to fight
against doubts in order to keep his faith in him.
That grip and that look were not those of a man
who wished to believe, who tried to believe, who
told himself and was obliged to keep on telling
himself that he believed in spite of all. No.
Those were the grip and the look of a man who
<i>knew</i>. The Bishop <i>knew</i>.</p>
<p>It was even easier to understand the Bishop&rsquo;s
silence than it had been to see why Ruth might not
speak of what she knew. The Bishop was an
official in a high place, entrusted with a dark secret.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
He must not speak of such things without a very
serious cause. But, of course, there was nothing
in this world so sacred as the life of an innocent
man. Of course, when the time and the need
came, the Bishop would speak.</p>
<p>So Jeffrey had pieced together his fragments of
fact and deduction. So he had watched and discovered
and reasoned and debated with himself.
He had not, of course, said a word of these things
to any one. The result was that, while he listened
to the plans which his lawyer, young Emmet
Dardis, laid for his defence&ndash;&ndash;plans which, in
the face of the incontestable facts which would be
brought against them, would certainly amount to
little or nothing&ndash;&ndash;he really paid little attention
to them. For, out of his reasoning and out of
the things his heart felt, he had built up around
himself an inner citadel, as it were, of defence
which no attack could shake. He had come to
feel, had made himself feel, that his life and his
name were absolutely safe in the keeping of these
two people&ndash;&ndash;the one a girl who loved him and
who would give her life for him, and the other a
true friend, a man of God, a true man. He had
nothing to fear. When the time came these two
would speak. It was true that he was outwardly
depressed by the concise and bitter conviction in
the words of the prosecuting attorney. For
Lemuel Squires was of the character that makes
the most terrible of criminal prosecutors&ndash;&ndash;an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
honest, narrow man who was always absolutely
convinced of the guilt of the accused from the
moment that a charge had been made. But inwardly
he had no fear.</p>
<p>The weight of evidence that would be brought
against him, the fact that his own best friends
would be obliged to give their oaths against him,
the very feeling of being accused and of having
to scheme and plan to prove his innocence to a
world that&ndash;&ndash;except here and there&ndash;&ndash;cared not
a whit whether he was innocent or guilty, all these
things bowed his head and brought his eyes down
to the floor. But they could not touch that inner
wall that he had built around himself. Ruth
<i>knew</i>; the Bishop <i>knew</i>.</p>
<p>The rasping speech of the prosecutor was
finished at last.</p>
<p>Old Erskine Beasley was the first witness called.</p>
<p>The prosecuting attorney took him sharply in
hand at once for though he had been called as a
witness for the prosecution it was well known
that he was unwilling to testify at all. So the attorney
had made no attempt to school him beforehand,
and he was determined now to allow him
to give only direct answers to the questions put to
him.</p>
<p>Two or three times the old man attempted to
explain, at the end of an answer, just why he had
gone up into the high hills the night before the
twentieth of August&ndash;&ndash;that he had heard that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
Rogers and a band of men had gone into the
woods to start fires. But he was ordered to stop,
and these parts of his answers were kept out of the
record. Finally he was rebuked savagely by the
Judge and ordered to confine himself to answering
the lawyer&rsquo;s questions, on pain of being arrested
for contempt. It was a high-handed proceeding
that showed the temper and the intention of the
Judge and a stir of protest ran around the courtroom.
But old Erskine Beasley was quelled.
He gave only the answers that the prosecutor
forced from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear a shot fired?&rdquo; he was asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear two shots fired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Jeffrey Whiting&rsquo;s gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you examine it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it been fired off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excused,&rdquo; snapped the prosecutor. And the
old man, almost in tears, came down from the
stand. He knew that his simple yes and no answers
had made the most damaging sort of evidence.</p>
<p>Then the prosecutor went back in the story to
establish a motive. He called several witnesses
who had been agents of the railroad and associated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
in one way or another with the murdered
man in his efforts to get options on the farm lands
in the hills. Even these witnesses, though they
were ready to give details and opinions which
might have been favorable to his side of the case,
he held down strictly to answering with a word
his own carefully thought out questions.</p>
<p>With these answers the prosecutor built up a
solid continuity of cause and effect from the day
when Rogers had first come into the hills to offer
Jeffrey Whiting a part in the work with himself
right up to the moment when the two had faced
each other that morning on Bald Mountain.</p>
<p>He showed that Jeffrey Whiting had begun to
undermine and oppose Rogers&rsquo; work from the
first. He showed why. Jeffrey Whiting came of
a family well known and trusted in the hills. The
young man had been quick to grasp the situation
and to believe that he could keep the people from
dealing at all with Rogers. Rogers&rsquo; work would
then be a failure. Jeffrey Whiting would then
be pointed to as the only man who could get the
options from the people. They would sell or
hold out at his word. The railroad would have
to deal with him direct, and at his terms.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting had gotten promises from
many of the owners that they would not sell or
even sign any paper until such time as he gave
them the word. Did those promises bind the
people to him? They did. Did they have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
same effect as if Jeffrey Whiting had obtained
actual options on the property? Yes. Would
the people stand by their promises? Yes. Then
Whiting had actually been obtaining what were
really options to himself, while pretending to hold
the people back in their own interest? Yes.</p>
<p>The prosecutor went on to draw out answer
after answer tending to show that it was not really
a conflict between the people and the railroad
that had been making trouble in the hills all summer;
that it was, in fact, merely a personal struggle
for influence and gain between Jeffrey Whiting
and the man who had been killed. It was skilfully
done and drawn out with all the exaggerated
effect of truth which bald negative and affirmative
answers invariably carry.</p>
<p>He went on to show that a bitter hatred had
grown up between the two men. Rogers had been
accused of hiring men to get Whiting out of the
way at a time in the early summer when many of
the people about French Village had been prepared
to sign Rogers&rsquo; options. Rogers had been
obliged to fly from the neighbourhood on account
of Whiting&rsquo;s anger. He had not returned to the
hills until the day before he was killed.</p>
<p>The people in the hills had talked freely of
what had happened on Bald Mountain on the
morning of August twentieth and in the hills during
the afternoon and night preceding. The
prosecutor knew the incidents and knew what men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
had said to each other. He now called Myron
Stocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet Jeffrey Whiting on the afternoon
of August nineteenth?&rdquo; was the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went lookin&rsquo; for him, to tell&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer, yes or no?&rdquo; shouted the attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the witness admitted sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him that Rogers was in the
hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he take his gun from you and start immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He followed me,&rdquo; the witness began. But
the Judge rapped warningly and the attorney
yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Rogers in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was settin&rsquo; fire to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The Judge
hammering furiously with his gavel drowned his
words. The attorney went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear a shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear two shots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;was making a lot of noise, he
tried to say. But his voice was smothered by
eruptions from the court and the attorney. He
was finally obliged to say that he had heard but
one shot. Then he was asked:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say when you came up and saw
the dead man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Mine got away, Jeff.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the difference, any of us
would&rsquo;ve done it if we had the chance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiting&rsquo;s gun had been fired?&rdquo; asked the attorney,
working back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question more and I will excuse you,&rdquo;
said the attorney, with a show of friendliness&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
see it is hard for you to testify against your
friend. Did you, standing there with the facts
fresh before you, conclude that Jeffrey Whiting
had fired the shot which killed Rogers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Emmet Dardis vigorously objected that
it was not proper, that the answer would not be
evidence. But the Judge overruled him sharply,
reminding him that this witness had been called
by the prosecution, that it was not the business of
opposing counsel to protect him. The witness
found himself forced to answer a simple yes.</p>
<p>One by one the other men who had been present
that fatal morning were called. Their answers
were identical, and as each one was forced
to give his yes to that last fateful question, condemning
Jeffrey Whiting out of the mouths of his
friends who had stood on the very ground of the
murder, it seemed that every avenue of hope for
him was closing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>On cross-examination, Emmet Dardis could do
little with the witnesses. He was gruffly reminded
by the Judge that the witnesses were not
his, that he must not attempt to draw any fresh
stories from them, that he might only examine
them on the facts which they had stated to the
District Attorney. And as the prosecutor had
pinned his witnesses down absolutely to answers
of known fact, there was really nothing in their
testimony that could be attacked.</p>
<p>With a feeling of uselessness and defeat, Emmet
Dardis let the last witness go. The State
promptly rested its case.</p>
<p>Dardis began calling his witnesses. He realised
how pitifully inadequate their testimony
would be when placed beside the chain of facts
which the District Attorney had pieced together.
They were in the main character witnesses, hardly
more. They could tell only of their long acquaintance
with Jeffrey Whiting, of their belief in
him, of their firm faith that in holding the people
back from giving the options to Rogers and the
railroad he had been acting in absolute good faith
and purely in the interests of the people. Not
one of these men had been near the scene of the
murder, for the railroad had planned its campaign
comprehensively and had subp&oelig;naed for its
side every man who could have had any direct
knowledge of the events leading up to the tragedy.
As line after line of their testimony was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
stricken from the record, as being irrelevant, it
was seen that the defence had little or no case.
Finally the Judge, tiring of ruling on the single
objections, made a general ruling that no testimony
which did not tend to reveal the identity
of the man who had shot Rogers could go into the
record.</p>
<p>Bishop Joseph Winthrop of Alden sat anxiously
watching the course of the trial. Beside
him sat little Father Ponfret from French Village.
The little French priest looked up from
time to time and guardedly studied the long angular
white head of his bishop as it towered above
him. He did not know, but he could guess some
of the struggle that was going on in the mind and
the heart of the Bishop.</p>
<p>The Bishop had come down to the trial to give
what aid he could, in the way of showing his confidence
and faith, to the case of the boy who stood
in peril of his life. In the beginning, when he
had first heard of Jeffrey&rsquo;s arrest, he had not
thought it possible that, even had he been guilty
of actually firing the shot, Jeffrey could be convicted
under such circumstances. Men must see
that the act was in defence of life and property.
But as he listened to the progress of the trial he
realised sadly that he had very much underestimated
the seriousness of the railroad people in the
matter and the hold which they had upon the machinery
of justice in Racquette County.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>He had gladly offered to go upon the stand and
tell the reason why Jeffrey Whiting had entered
into this fight against the railroad. He would associate
himself and his own good name with the
things that Jeffrey Whiting had done, so that the
two might stand before men together. But he
now saw that it would be of no avail. His words
would be swept aside as irrelevant.</p>
<p>One thing and only one thing would now avail
Jeffrey Whiting. This morning on his arrival in
Danton, the Bishop had been angered at learning
that the two men whose lives he had
saved that night by the lake at French Village
had escaped from the train as they were being
brought from Lowville to Danton to testify at
this trial.</p>
<p>Whether they could have told anything of value
to Jeffrey Whiting was not known. Certainly
they were now gone, and, almost surely, by the
connivance of the railroad people. The Bishop
had their confession in his pocket at this minute,
but there was nothing in it concerning the murder.
He had intended to read it into the record of the
trial. He saw that he would not be allowed to
do so.</p>
<p>One thing and only one thing would now avail
Jeffrey Whiting. Jeffrey Whiting would be condemned
to death, unless, within the hour, a man
or woman should rise up in this room and swear:
Jeffrey Whiting did not kill Samuel Rogers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Rafe Gadbeau did the deed. I saw him. Or&ndash;&ndash;He
told me so.</p>
<p>The Bishop remembered how that day last winter
he had set the boy upon this course which had
brought him here into this court and into the
shadow of public disgrace and death. If Jeffrey
Whiting had actually fired the shot that had cut
off a human life, would not he, Joseph, Bishop of
Alden, have shared a measure of the responsibility?
He would.</p>
<p>And if Jeffrey Whiting, through no fault of
his own, but through a chain of circumstances,
stood now in danger of death, was not he, Joseph
Winthrop, who had started the boy into the midst
of these circumstances, in a way responsible? He
was.</p>
<p>Could Joseph Winthrop by rising up in this
court and saying: &ldquo;Rafe Gadbeau killed Samuel
Rogers&ndash;&ndash;He told me so&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;could he thus
save Jeffrey Whiting from a felon&rsquo;s fate? He
could. Nine words, no more, would do.</p>
<p>And if he could so save Jeffrey Whiting and
did not do what was necessary&ndash;&ndash;did not speak
those nine words&ndash;&ndash;would he, Joseph Winthrop,
be responsible for the death or at least the imprisonment
and ruin of Jeffrey Whiting? He
would.</p>
<p>Then what would Joseph Winthrop do?
Would he speak those nine words? He would
not.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>There was no claim of life or death that had
the force to break the seal and let those nine words
escape his lips.</p>
<p>There was no conflict, no battle, no indecision
in the Bishop&rsquo;s mind as he sat there waiting for
his name to be called. He loved the boy who sat
there in the prisoner&rsquo;s stand before him. He felt
responsible for him and the situation in which he
was. He cared nothing for the dead man or the
dead man&rsquo;s secret, as such. Yet he would go
up there and defy the law of humanity and the
law of men, because he was bound by the law that
is beyond all other law; the law of the eternal salvation
of men&rsquo;s souls.</p>
<p>But there was no reasoning, no weighing of
the issue in his mind. His course was fixed by the
eternal Institution of God. There was nothing
to be determined, nothing to be argued. He was
caught between the greater and the lesser law and
he could only stand and be ground between the
working of the two.</p>
<p>If he had reasoned he would have said that Almighty
God had ordained the salvation of men
through the confession of sin. Therefore the salvation
of men depended on the inviolability of the
seal of the confessional. But he did not reason.
He merely sat through his torture, waiting.</p>
<p>When his name was called, he walked heavily
forward and took his place standing beside the
chair that was set for him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>At Dardis&rsquo; question, the Bishop began to speak
freely and rapidly. He told of the coming of
Jeffrey Whiting to him for advice. He repeated
what he had said to the boy, and from that point
went on to sketch the things that had been happening
in the hills. He wanted to get clearly before
the minds of the jurymen the fact that he
had advised and directed Jeffrey Whiting in everything
that the boy had done.</p>
<p>The Judge was loath to show any open discourtesy
to the Bishop. But he saw that he must
stop him. His story could not but have a powerful
effect upon even this jury. Looking past the
Bishop and addressing Dardis, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this testimony pertinent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, if Your Honor pardon me,&rdquo; said
the Bishop, turning quickly. &ldquo;It goes to prove
that Jeffrey Whiting could not have committed
the crime charged, any more than I could have
done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop did not stop to consider carefully
the logic or the legal phraseology of his answer.
He hurried on with his story to the jury. He
related his message from Albany to Jeffrey Whiting.
He told of his ride into the hills. He told
of the capture of the two men in the night at
French Village. They should be here now as
witnesses. They had escaped. But he held in his
hand a written confession, written and sealed by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
justice of the peace, made by the two men. He
would read this to the jury.</p>
<p>He began reading rapidly. But before he had
gotten much past the opening sentences, the Judge
saw that this would not do. It was the story of
the plan to set the fire, and it must not be read in
court.</p>
<p>He rapped sharply with his gavel, and when
the Bishop stopped, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the murder of Samuel Rogers mentioned
in that paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Your Honor. But there are&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is irrelevant,&rdquo; interrupted the Judge
shortly. &ldquo;It cannot go before the jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop was beaten; he knew he could do
no more.</p>
<p>Emmet Dardis was desperate. There was not
the slightest hope for his client&ndash;&ndash;unless&ndash;&ndash;unless.
He knew that Rafe Gadbeau had made confession
to the Bishop. He had wanted to ask
the Bishop this morning, if there was not some
way. He had not dared. Now he dared. The
Bishop stood waiting for his further questions.
There might be some way or some help, thought
Dardis; maybe some word had dropped which was
not a part of the real confession. He said
quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were with Rafe Gadbeau at his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting leaned forward in his chair,
his eyes eager and confident. His heart shouting
that here was his deliverance. Here was the
hour and the need! The Bishop would speak!</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s eyes fell upon the prisoner for
an instant. Then he looked full into the eyes of
his questioner and he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do. Thank you, Bishop,&rdquo; said
Dardis in a low, broken voice.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting fell back in his chair. The
light of confidence died slowly, reluctantly out of
his eyes. The Bishop had spoken. The Bishop
had <i>lied</i>! He <i>knew</i>! And he had <i>lied</i>!</p>
<p>As the Bishop walked slowly back to his seat,
Ruth Lansing saw the terrible suffering of the
spirit reflected in his face. If she were questioned
about that night, she must do as he had done.</p>
<p>Mother in Heaven, she prayed in agony, must
I do that? <i>Can</i> I do that?</p>
<p>Oh! She had never thought it would come to
this. How <i>could</i> it happen like this! How could
any one think that she would ever stand like this,
alone in all the world, with the fate of her love
in her hands, and not be able to speak the few
little words that would save him to her and life!</p>
<p>She <i>would</i> save him! She <i>would</i> speak the
words! What did she care for that wicked man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
who had died yelling out that he was a murderer?
Why should she keep a secret of his? One night
in the early summer she had lain all through the
night in the woods outside a cabin and wished
for a way to kill that man. Why should she
guard a secret that was no good to him or to any
one now?</p>
<p>Who was it that said she must not speak?
The Catholic Church. Then she would be a Catholic
no longer. She would renounce it this minute.
She had never promised anything like this.
But, on the instant, she knew that that would not
free her. She knew that she could throw off the
outward garment of the Church, but still she
would not be free to speak the words. The
Church itself could not free her from the seal of
the secret. What use, then, to fly from the
Church, to throw off the Church, when the bands
of silence would still lie mighty and unbreakable
across her lips.</p>
<p>That awful night on the Gaunt Rocks flamed up
before her, and what she saw held her.</p>
<p>What she saw was not merely a church giving
a sacrament. It was not the dramatic falling of
a penitent at the feet of a priest. It was not a
poor Frenchman of the hills screaming out his
crime in the agony and fear of death.</p>
<p>What she saw was a world, herself standing all
alone in it. What she saw was the soul of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
world giving up its sin into the scale of God from
which&ndash;&ndash;Heart break or world burn!&ndash;&ndash;that sin
must never be disturbed.</p>
<p>As she went slowly across the front of the room
in answer to her name, a girl came out of one of
the aisles and stood almost in her path. Ruth
looked up and found herself staring dully into
the fierce, piercing eyes of Cynthe Cardinal. She
saw the look in those eyes which she had recognised
for the first time that day at French Village&ndash;&ndash;the
terrible mother-hunger look of love,
ready to die for its own. And though the girl
said nothing, Ruth could hear the warning words:
Remember! You love Jeffrey Whiting.</p>
<p>How well that girl knew!</p>
<p>Dardis had called Ruth only to contradict a
point which he had not been able to correct in the
testimony of Myron Stocking. But since he had
dared to bring up the matter of Rafe Gadbeau to
the Bishop, he had become more desperate, and
bolder. Ruth might speak. And there was always
a chance that the dying man had said something
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were with Jeffrey Whiting on the afternoon
when word was brought to him that suspicious
men had been seen in the hills?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the name of Rogers mentioned by either
Stocking or Whiting?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he flashed the question upon her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Rafe Gadbeau say when he was
dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth staggered, quivering in every nerve.
The impact of the sudden, startling question leaping
upon her over-wrought mind was nothing to
what followed. For, in answer to the question,
there came a scream, a terrified, agonised scream,
mingled of fright and remorse and&ndash;&ndash;relief. A
scream out of the fire. A scream from death.
<i>On my knee I dropped and shot him, shot Rogers
as he stood.</i></p>
<p>Again Jeffrey Whiting leaned forward smiling.
Again the inner citadel of his hope stood
strong about him. Ruth was there to speak the
word that would free him! Her love would set
him free! It was the time. Ruth <i>knew</i>. He
would rather have it this way. He was almost
glad that the Bishop had lied. Ruth <i>knew</i>.
Ruth would speak.</p>
<p>The words of that terrible scream went searing
through Ruth&rsquo;s brain and down into the very
roots of her being. Oh! for the power to shout
them out to the ends of the earth!</p>
<p>But she looked levelly at Dardis and in a clear
voice answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, at his word, she stumbled down out of
the stand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>Again Jeffrey Whiting fell back into his seat.</p>
<p><i>Ruth</i> had <i>lied</i>!</p>
<p>The walls of his inner citadel had fallen in and
crushed him.</p>

<h3>SEIGNEUR DIEU, WHITHER GO I?</h3>
</div>
<p>The Bishop walked brokenly from the courthouse
and turned up the street toward the little
church. He had not been the same man since his
experience of those two terrible nights in the
hills. They had aged him and shaken him visibly.
But those nights of suffering and superhuman effort
had only attacked him physically. They had
broken the spring of his step and had drawn
heavily upon the vigour and the vital reserves
which his years of simple living had left stored
up in him. He had fought with fire. He had
looked death in the face. He had roused his soul
to master the passions of men. No man who has
already reached almost the full allotted span of
life may do these things without showing the outward
effects of them. But these things had struck
only at the clay of the body. They had not
touched the quick spirit of the man within.</p>
<p>The trial through which he had passed to-day
had cut deep into the spiritual fibre of his being.
If Joseph Winthrop had been given the alternative
of speaking his secret or giving up his life, he
would have offered the few years that might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
his, without question or halting. For he was a
man of simple, single mind. He never quibbled
or thought of taking back any of the things which
he had given to Christ. Thirty years ago he had
made his compact with the Master, and he had
never blinked the fact that every time a priest puts
on a stole to receive the secret of another&rsquo;s soul
he puts his life in pledge for the sanctity of that
secret. It was a simple business, unclouded by
any perplexities or confusion.</p>
<p>Never had he thought of the alternative which
had this day been forced upon him. Years ago
he had given his own life entire to Christ. The
snapping of it here at this point or a few spaces
farther on would be a matter of no more moment
than the length of a thread. This world had
nothing to give him, nothing to withhold from
him. But to guard his secret at the cost of another
life, and that a young, vigorous, battling
life full of future and promise, full of youth and
the glory of living, the life of a boy he loved&ndash;&ndash;that
was another matter. Never had he reckoned
with a thing such as that. Life had always been
so direct, so square-cut for Joseph Winthrop. To
think right, to do right, to serve God; these things
had always seemed very simple. But the thing
that he had done to-day was breaking his heart.
He could not have done otherwise. He had been
given no choice, to be sure.</p>
<p>But was it possible that God would have allowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
things to come to that issue, if somewhere,
at some turn in that line of circumstances which
had led up to this day, Joseph Winthrop had not
done a wrong? It did not seem possible. Somewhere
he had done wrong or he had done foolishly&ndash;&ndash;and,
where men go to direct the lives of
others, to do unwisely is much the same as to do
wickedly.</p>
<p>What use to go over the things that he had
done, the things that he had advised? What use
to say, here he had done his best, there he thought
only of the right and the wise thing. Somewhere
he had spoken foolishly, or he had been headstrong
in his interference, or he had acted without
thought and prayer. What use to go over the
record? He could only carry this matter to God
and let Him see his heart.</p>
<p>He stumbled in the half light of the darkened
little church and sank heavily into the last pew.
Out of the sorrow and anguish of his heart he
cried out from afar to the Presence on the little
altar, where he, Bishop of Alden, had often
spoken with much authority.</p>
<p>When Cynthe Cardinal saw Ruth Lansing go up
into the witness stand she sank down quietly into
a front seat and seemed fairly to devour the other
girl with the steady gaze of her fierce black eyes.
She hung upon every fleeting wave of the contending
emotions that showed themselves on Ruth&rsquo;s
face. She was convinced that this girl knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Rafe Gadbeau had confessed to the murder of
Samuel Rogers and that Jeffrey Whiting was innocent.
She had not thought that Ruth would be
called as a witness, and Dardis, in fact, had only
decided upon it at the last moment.</p>
<p>Once Cynthe Cardinal had been very near to
hating this girl, for she had seen Rafe Gadbeau
leave herself at a dance, one afternoon a very long
time ago, and spend the greater part of the afternoon
talking gaily to Ruth Lansing. Now Rafe
Gadbeau was gone. There was nothing left of
him whom Cynthe Cardinal had loved but a memory.
But that memory was as much to her as was
the life of Jeffrey Whiting to this other girl. She
was sorry for the other girl. Who would not be?
What would that girl do? If the question was not
asked directly, it was not likely that the girl would
tell what she knew. She would not wish to tell.
She would certainly try to avoid it. But if the
question came to her of a sudden, without warning,
without time for thought? What then?
Would that girl be strong enough to deny, to deny
and to keep on denying?</p>
<p>Who could tell? The girl was a Catholic.
But she was a convert. She did not know the
terrible secret of the confessional as they knew it
who had been born to the Faith.</p>
<p>Cynthe herself had meant to keep away from
this trial. She knew it was no place for her to
carry the awful secret that she had hidden away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
in her heart. No matter how deeply she might
have it hidden, the fear hung over her that men
would probe for it. A word, a look, a hint might
be enough to set some on the search for it and
she had had a superstition that it was a secret of a
nature that it could not be hidden forever. Some
day some one would tear it from her heart. She
knew that it was dangerous for her to be in Danton
during these days when the hill people were
talking of nothing but the killing of Rogers and
hunting for any possible fact that might make
Jeffrey Whiting&rsquo;s story believable. But she had
been drawn irresistibly to the trial and had sat all
day yesterday and to-day listening feverishly,
avidly to every word that was said, waiting to
hear, and praying against hearing the name of
the man she had loved. The idea of protecting
his name and his memory from the blight of his
deed had become more than a religion, more than
a sacred trust to her. It filled not only her own
thought and life but it seemed even to take up that
great void in her world which Rafe Gadbeau had
filled.</p>
<p>When she had heard his name mentioned in that
sudden questioning of the Bishop, she had almost
jumped from her seat to cry out to him that he
must know nothing. But that was foolish, she
reflected. They might as well have asked the
stones on the top of the Gaunt Rocks to tell Rafe
Gadbeau&rsquo;s secret as to ask it from the Bishop.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>But this girl was different. You could not tell
what she might do under the test. If she stood
the test, if she kept the seal unbroken upon her
lips, then would Cynthe be her willing slave for
life. She would love that girl, she would fetch
for her, work for her, die for her!</p>
<p>When that point-blank question came leaping
upon the tortured girl in the stand, Cynthe rose
to her feet. She expected to hear the girl stammer
and blurt out something that would give them
a chance to ask her further questions. But when
she saw the girl reel and quiver in pain, when she
saw her gasp for breath and self-control, when she
saw the hunted agony in her eyes, a great light
broke in upon the heart of Cynthe Cardinal.
Here was not a pale girl of the convent who could
not know what love was! Here was a woman,
a sister woman, who could suffer, who for the sake
of one greater thing could trample her love under
foot, and who could and did sum it all up in one
steady word&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthe Cardinal revolted. Her quickened
heart could not look at the torture of the other
girl. She wanted to run forward and throw herself
at the feet of the other girl as she came staggering
down from the stand and implore her pardon.
She wanted to cry out to her that she must
tell! That no man, alive or dead, was worth
all this! For Cynthe Cardinal knew that truth
bitterly. Instead, she turned and ran like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
frightened, wild thing out of the room and up the
street.</p>
<p>She had seen the Bishop come direct from the
little church to the court. And as she watched
his face when he came down from the stand, she
knew instinctively that he was going back there.
Cynthe understood. Even M&rsquo;sieur the Bishop
who was so wise and strong, he was troubled. He
thought much of the young Whiting. He would
have business with God.</p>
<p>She slipped noiselessly in at the door of the
church and saw the Bishop kneeling there at the
end of the pew, bowed and broken.</p>
<p>He was first aware of her when he heard a
frightened, hurrying whisper at his elbow. Some
one was kneeling in the aisle beside him, saying:</p>
<p><i>Mon Pere, je me &rsquo;cuse.</i></p>
<p>The ritual would have told him to rise and go to
the confessional. But here was a soul that was
pouring its secret out to him in a torrential rush of
words and sobs that would not wait for ritual.
The Bishop listened without raising his head. He
had neither the will nor the power to break in upon
that cruel story that had been torturing its keeper
night and day. He knew that it was true, knew
what the end of it would be. But still he must be
careful to give no word that would show that he
knew what was coming. The French of the hills
and of Beaupre was a little too rapid for him but
it was easy to follow the thread of the story.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
When she had finished and was weeping quietly,
the Bishop prompted gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now? my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, <i>Mon Pere</i>, must I tell? I would
not tell. I loved Rafe Gadbeau. As long as I
shall live I shall love him. For his good name
I would die. But I cannot see the suffering of
that girl, Ruth. <i>Mon Pere</i>, it is too much! I
cannot stand it. Yet I cannot go there before
men and call my love a murderer. Consider,
<i>Mon Pere</i>. There is another way. I, too, am
guilty. I wished for the death of that man. I
would have killed him myself, for he had made
Rafe Gadbeau do many things that he would not
have done. He made my love a murderer. I
went to keep Rafe Gadbeau from the setting of
the fire. But I would have killed that man myself
with the gun if I could. So I hated him.
When I saw him fall, I clapped my hands in glee.
See, <i>Mon Pere</i>, I am guilty. And I called joyfully
to my love to run with me and save himself,
for he was now free from that man forever. But
he ran in the path of the fire because he feared
those other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see, <i>Mon Pere</i>, I am guilty. I will go
and tell the court that I am the guilty one. I will
say that my hand shot that man. See, I will tell
the story. I have told it many times to myself.
Such a straight story I shall tell. And they will
believe. I will make them believe. And they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
will not hurt a girl much,&rdquo; she said, dropping back
upon her native shrewdness to strengthen her plea.
&ldquo;The railroad does not care who killed Rogers.
They want only to punish the young Whiting.
And the court will believe, as I shall tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my daughter,&rdquo; said the Bishop, temporising.
&ldquo;It would not be true. We must not lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But M&rsquo;sieur the Bishop, himself,&rdquo; the girl
argued swiftly, evidently separating the priest in
the confessional from the great bishop in his public
walk, &ldquo;he himself, on the stand&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>The Bishop held the silence of the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Pere</i> will make me tell, then&ndash;&ndash;the
truth,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;<i>Mon Pere</i>, I cannot!
I&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us consider,&rdquo; the Bishop broke in deliberately.
&ldquo;Suppose he had told this thing to you
when he was dying. You would have said to him:
Your soul may not rest if you leave another to
suffer for your deed. Would he not have told
you to tell and clear the other man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To escape Hell,&rdquo; said the girl quickly, &ldquo;yes.
He would have said: Tell everything; tell anything!&rdquo;
In the desolate forlornness of her grief
she had not left to her even an illusion. Just as
he was, she had known the man, good and bad,
brave and cowardly&ndash;&ndash;and had loved him.
Would always love him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not speak of Hell,&rdquo; said the Bishop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
gently. &ldquo;In that hour he would have seen the
right. He would have told you to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he confessed to M&rsquo;sieur the Bishop himself,&rdquo;
she retorted quickly, still seeming to forget
that she was talking to the prelate in person, but
springing the trap of her quick wit and sound
Moral Theology back upon him with a vengeance,
&ldquo;and he gave <i>him</i> no leave to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop in a panic hurried past the dangerous
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had left a debt, would you pay it for him,
my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Pere</i>, with the bones of my hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider, then, he is not now the man that
you knew. The man who was blind and walked
in dark places. He is now a soul in a world where
a great light shines about him. He knows now
that which he did not know here&ndash;&ndash;Truth.
He sees the things which here he did not see. He
stands alone in the great open space of the Beyond.
He looks up to God and cries: <i>Seigneur
Dieu</i>, whither go I?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God replying, asks him why does he hesitate,
standing in the open place. Would he come
back to the world?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he answers: &lsquo;No, my God; but I have
left a debt behind and another man&rsquo;s life stands
in pledge for my debt; I cannot go forward with
that debt unpaid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then God: &lsquo;And is there none to cancel the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
debt? Is there not one in all that world who
loved you? Were you, then, so wicked that none
loved you who will pay the debt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he will answer with a lifted heart: &lsquo;My
God, yes; there was one, a girl; in spite of me, she
loved me; she will make the debt right; only because
she loved me may I be saved; she will speak
and the debt will be right; my God, let me go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s French was sometimes wonderfully
and fearfully put together. But the girl
saw the pictures. The imagery was familiar to
her race and faith. She was weeping softly, with
almost a little break of joy among the tears. For
she saw the man, whom she had loved in spite of
what he was, lifted now out of the weaknesses and
sins of life. And her love leaped up quickly to
the ideal and the illusions that every woman craves
for and clings to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the Bishop was going on quietly, &ldquo;is
the new man we are to consider; the one who
stands in the light and sees Truth. We must not
hear the little mouthings of the world. Does he
care for the opinions or the words that are said
here? See, he stands in the great open space,
all alone, and dares to look up to the Great God
and tell Him all. Will you be afraid to stand in
the court and tell these people, who do not matter
at all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, it is not for Jeffrey Whiting. It
is not for the sake of Ruth Lansing. It is because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
the man you loved calls back to you, from
where he has gone, to do the thing which the wisdom
he has now learned tells him must be done.
He has learned the lesson of eternal Truth. He
would have you tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Pere</i>, I will tell the tale,&rdquo; said the girl
simply as she rose from her knees. &ldquo;I will go
quickly, while I have yet the courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop went with her to one of the counsel
rooms in the courthouse and sent for Dardis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; he told the lawyer, &ldquo;has a story
to tell. I think you would do wisely to put her
on the stand and let her tell it in her own way.
She will make no mistakes. They will not be able
to break her down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Bishop went back to take up again his
business with God.</p>
<p>As a last, and almost hopeless, resort, Jeffrey
Whiting had been put upon the stand in his own
defence. There was nothing he could tell which
the jurors had not already heard in one form or
another. Everybody had heard what he had said
that morning on Bald Mountain. He had not
been believed even then, by men who had never
had a reason to doubt his simple word. There
was little likelihood that he would be believed here
now by these jurors, whose minds were already
fixed by the facts and the half truths which they
had been hearing. But there was some hope that
his youth and the manly sincerity with which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
clung to his simple story might have some effect.
It might be that a single man on that jury would
be so struck with his single sturdy tale that he
would refuse to disbelieve it altogether. You
could never tell what might strike a man on a jury.
So Dardis argued.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting did not care. If his counsel
wished him to tell his story he would do so. It
would not matter. His own friends did not believe
his story. Nobody believed it. Two people
<i>knew</i> that it was true. And those two people
had stood up there upon the stand and sworn that
they did not know. One of them was a good man,
a man of God, a man he would have trusted with
every dear thing that life held. That man had
stood up there and lied. The other was a girl
whom he loved, and who, he was sure, loved him.</p>
<p>It had not been easy for Ruth to tell that lie&ndash;&ndash;or
maybe she did not consider it a lie: he had seen
her suffer terribly in the telling of it. He was
beginning to feel that he did not care much what
was the outcome of the trial. Life was a good
thing, it was true. And death, or a life of death,
as a murderer, was worse than twenty common
deaths. But that had all dropped into the background.
Only one big thing stood before him.
It laid hold upon him and shook him and took
from him his interest in every other fact in the
world.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing, he thought he could say, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
never before in her life told a lie. Why should
she have ever told a lie. She had never had reason
to fear any one; and they only lie who fear.
He would have said that the fear of death could
not have made Ruth Lansing lie. Yet she had
stood up there and lied.</p>
<p>For what? For a church. For a religion to
which she had foolishly given herself. For that
she had given up him. For that she had given up
her conscience. For that she had given up her
own truth!</p>
<p>It was unbelievable. But he had sat here and
listened to it.</p>
<p>He had heard her lie simply and calmly in answer
to a question which meant life or death to
him. She had known that. She could not have
escaped knowing it if she had tried. There was
no way in which she could have fooled herself or
been persuaded into believing that she was not
lying or that she was not taking from him his last
hope of life.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting did not try to grapple or reason
with the fact. What was the use? It was the
end of all things. He merely sat and gazed
dumbly at the monstrous thing that filled his whole
mental vision.</p>
<p>He went forward to the witness chair and stood
woodenly until some one told him to be seated.
He answered the questions put him automatically,
without looking either at the questioner or at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
jury who held his fate in their hands. Men who
had been watching the alert, keen-faced boy all day
yesterday and through to-day wondered what had
happened to him. Was he breaking down?
Would he confess? Or had he merely ceased
hoping and turned sullen and dumb?</p>
<p>Without any trace of emotion or interest, he
told how he had raced forward, charging upon the
man who was setting the fire. He looked vacantly
at the Judge while the latter ordered that part of
his words stricken out which told what the man
was doing. He showed no resentment, no feeling
of any kind. He related how the man had run
away from him, trailing the torch through the
brush, and again he did not seem to notice the
Judge&rsquo;s anger in cautioning him not to mention
the fire again.</p>
<p>At his counsel&rsquo;s direction, he went through a
lifeless pantomime of falling upon one knee and
pointing his rifle at the fleeing man. Now the
man turned and faced him. Then he heard the
shot which killed Rogers come from the woods.
He dropped his own rifle and went forward to
look at the dying man. He picked up the torch
and threw it away.</p>
<p>Then he turned to fight the fire. (This time
the Judge did not rule out the word.) Then his
rifle had exploded in his hands, the bullet going
just past his ear. The charge had scorched his
neck. It was a simple story. The thing <i>might</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
have happened. It was entirely credible. There
were no contradictions in it. But the manner of
Jeffrey Whiting, telling it, gave no feeling of
reality. It was not the manner of a man telling
one of the most stirring things of his life. He
was not telling what he saw and remembered and
felt and was now living through. Rather, he
seemed to be going over a wearying, many-times-told
tale that he had rehearsed to tedium. A
sleeping man might have told it so. The jury
was left entirely unconvinced, though puzzled by
the manner of the recital.</p>
<p>Even Lemuel Squires&rsquo; harping cross questions
did not rouse Jeffrey to any attention to the story
that he had told. At each question he went back
to the point indicated and repeated his recital dully
and evenly without any thought of what the District
Attorney was trying to make him say. He
was not thinking of the District Attorney nor of
the story. He was still gazing mentally in stupid
wonder at the horrible fact that Ruth Lansing had
lied his life away at the word of her church.</p>
<p>When he had gotten back to the little railed enclosure
where he was again the prisoner, he sat
down heavily to wait for the end of this wholly
irrelevant business of the trial. Another witness
was called. He did not know that there was another.
He had expected that Squires would begin
his speech at once.</p>
<p>He noticed that this witness was a girl from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
French Village whom he had seen several times.
Now he remembered that she was Rafe Gadbeau&rsquo;s
girl. What did they bring her here for? She
could not know anything, and why did they want
to pester the poor thing? Didn&rsquo;t the poor little
thing look sorry and troubled enough without
fetching her down here to bring it all up to her?
He roused himself to look reassuringly at the girl,
as though to tell her not to mind, that it did not
matter anyway, that he knew she could not help
him, and that she must not let them hurt her.</p>
<p>Dardis, to forestall objections and to ensure
Cynthe against interruptions from the prosecutor
or the Judge, had told her to say nothing about
fire but to speak directly about the killing of Rogers
and nothing else. So when, after she had been
sworn, he told her to relate the things that led up
to the killing, she began at the very beginning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years ago,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Rafe Gadbeau
was in Utica. A man was killed in a crowd.
His knife had been used to kill the man. Rafe
Gadbeau did not do that. Often he has sworn
to me that he did not know who had done it. But
a detective, a man named Rogers, found the knife
and traced it to Rafe Gadbeau. He did not arrest
him. No, he kept the knife, saying that some day
he would call upon Rafe Gadbeau for the price
of his silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last summer this man Rogers came into the
woods looking for some one to help get the people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
to sell their land. He saw Rafe Gadbeau. He
showed him the knife. He told him that whatever
he laid upon him to do, that he must do. He
made him lie to the people. He made him attack
the young Whiting. He made him do many
things that he would not do, for Rafe Gadbeau
was not a bad man, only foolish sometimes. And
Rafe Gadbeau was sore under the yoke of fear
that this man had put upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At times he said to me, &lsquo;Cynthe, I will kill
this man one day, and that will be the end of all.&rsquo;
But I said, &lsquo;<i>Non, non, mon Rafe</i>, we will marry in
the fall, and go away to far Beaupre where he will
never see you again, and we will not know that he
ever lived.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynthe had forgotten her audience. She was
telling over to herself the tragedy of her little life
and her great love. Genius could not have told
her how better to tell it for the purpose for which
her story was here needed. Dardis thanked his
stars that he had taken the Bishop&rsquo;s advice, to let
her get through with it in her own way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not time for us to marry yet,&rdquo; she
went on. &ldquo;Then came the morning of the nineteenth
August. I was sitting on the back steps
of my aunt&rsquo;s house by the Little Tupper, putting
apples on a string to hang up in the hot sun to
dry.&rdquo; The Judge turned impatiently on his bench
and shrugged his shoulders. The girl saw and
her eyes blazed angrily at him. Who was he to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
shrug his shoulders! Was it not important, this
story of her love and her tragedy! Thereafter
the Judge gave her the most rigid attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rafe Gadbeau came and sat down on the steps
at my feet. I saw that he was troubled. &lsquo;What
is it, <i>mon Rafe</i>?&rsquo; I asked. He groaned and said
one bad word. Then he told me that he had just
had a message from Rogers to meet him at the
head of the rail with three men and six horses.
&lsquo;What to do, <i>mon Rafe</i>?&rsquo; &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;though I can guess. But I will not tell you,
Cynthe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will not go, <i>mon Rafe</i>. Promise me
you will not go. Hide away, and we will slip
down to the Falls of St. Regis and be married&ndash;&ndash;me,
I do not care for the grand wedding in the
church here&ndash;&ndash;and then we will get away to
Beaupre. Promise me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Bien</i>, Cynthe, I promise. I will not go to
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a man&rsquo;s promise. I knew he would
go in the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched and followed. I did not know
what I could do. But I followed, hoping that
somewhere I could get Rafe before they had done
what they intended and we could run away together
with clean hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw that they had gone toward the
railroad I turned aside and climbed up to the Bald
Mountain. I knew they would all come back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
there together. I waited until it was dark and
they came. They would do nothing in the night.
I waited for the morning. Then I would find
Rafe and bring him away. I was desperate. I
was a wild girl that night. If I could have found
that Rogers and come near him I would have killed
him myself. I hated him, for he had made me
much suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning I was in the woods near them.
I saw Rafe. But that Rogers kept him always
near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Rogers go out of the wood a little to
look. Rafe was a little way from him and coming
slowly toward me. I called to him. He did
not hear. I saw the look in his face. It was the
look of one who has made up his mind to kill.
Again I called to him. But he did not hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Rogers go running along the edge of the
wood. Now he came running back toward Rafe.
He stopped and turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young Whiting was on his knee with the
rifle raised to shoot. I looked to Rafe. The
sound of his gun struck me as I turned my face.
The bullet struck Rogers in the back of the head.
I saw. The young Whiting had not fired at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned and ran, calling to Rafe to follow me.
&lsquo;Come with me, <i>mon Rafe</i>,&rsquo; I called. &lsquo;I, too, am
guilty. I would have killed him in the night.
Come with me. We will escape. The fire will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
cover all. None will ever know but you and me,
and I am guilty as you. Come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he did not hear. And I wished him to
hear. Oh! I wished him at least to hear me say
that I took the share of the guilt, for I did not
wish to be separated from him in this world or the
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he ran back always into the path of the
fire, for those other men, the old M&rsquo;sieur Beasley
and the others, were closing behind him and the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was speaking freely of the fire now, but
it did not matter. Her story was told. The big,
hot tears were flowing freely and her voice rose
into a cry of farewell as she told the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was down and I saw the fire roll over
him. Oh, the great God, who is good, was cruel
that day! Again, at the last, I saw him up and
running on again. Then the fire shut him out
from my sight, and God took him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all. I ran for the Little Tupper and
was safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dardis did not try to draw another word from
her on any part of the story. He was artist
enough to know that the story was complete in its
na&iuml;ve and tragic simplicity. And he was judge
enough of human nature to understand that the
jury would remember better and hold more easily
her own unthought, clipped expressions than they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
would any more connected elaborations he might
try to make her give.</p>
<p>Lemuel Squires was a narrow man, a born prosecutor.
He had always been a useful officer to the
railroad powers because he was convinced of the
guilt of any prisoner whom it was his business to
bring into court. He regarded a verdict of acquittal
as hardly less than a personal insult. He
denied that there were ever two sides to any case.
But his very narrowness now confounded him
here. This girl&rsquo;s story was true. It was astounding,
impossible, subversive of all things. But it
was true.</p>
<p>His mind, one-sided as it was always, had room
for only the one thing. The story was true. He
asked her a few unimportant questions, leading
nowhere, and let her go. Then he began his summing
up to the jury.</p>
<p>It was a half-hearted, wholly futile plea to them
to remember the facts by which the prisoner had
already been convicted and to put aside the girl&rsquo;s
dramatic story. He was still convinced that the
prisoner was guilty. But&ndash;&ndash;the girl&rsquo;s story was
true. His mind was not nimble enough to escape
the shock of that fact. He was helpless under it.
His pleading was spiritless and wandering while
his mind stood aside to grapple with that one
astounding thing.</p>
<p>The Judge, however, in charging the jury was
troubled by none of these hampering limitations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
of mind. He had always regarded the taking and
discussion of evidence as a rather wearisome and
windy business. All democracy was full of such
wasteful and time-killing ways of coming to a conclusion.
The boy was guilty. The powers who
controlled the county had said he was guilty.
Why spoil good time, then, quibbling.</p>
<p>He charged the jury that the girl&rsquo;s testimony
was no more credible than that of a dozen other
witnesses&ndash;&ndash;which was quite true. All had told
the truth as they understood it, and saw it. But
he glided smoothly over the one important difference.
The girl had seen the act. No other, not
even the accused himself, had been able to say that.</p>
<p>He delivered an extemporaneous and daringly
false lecture on the comparative force of evidence,
intended only to befog the minds of the jurors.
But the effect of it was exactly the opposite to that
which he had intended, for, whereas they had up
to now held a fairly clear view of the things that
had been proven by the adroit handling of his facts
by the District Attorney, they now forgot all that
structure of guilt which he so laboriously built up
and remembered only one thing clearly. And
that thing was the story of Cynthe Cardinal.</p>
<p>Without leaving their seats, they intimated that
they had come to an agreement.</p>
<p>The Judge, glowering dubiously at them, demanded
to know what it was.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting stood up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>The foreman rose and faced the Judge stubbornly,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge polled the jury, glaring fiercely at
each man as his name was called, but one after
another the men arose and answered gruffly for
acquittal. The hill people rushed from the courthouse,
running for their horses and shouting the
verdict as they ran. Then sleepy little Danton
awoke from its September drowse and was aware
that something real had happened. The elaborate
machinery of prosecution, the whole political
power of the county, the mighty grip and pressure
of the railroad power had all been set at nothing
by the tragic little love story of an ignorant French
girl from the hills.</p>
<p>Dardis led Jeffrey Whiting down from the place
where he had been a prisoner and brought him to
his mother.</p>
<p>Jeffrey turned a long searching gaze down into
his mother&rsquo;s eyes as he stooped to kiss her. What
he saw filled him with a bitterness that all the
years of his life would not efface. What he saw
was not the sprightly, cheery, capable woman who
had been his mother, but a grey, trembling old
woman, broken in body and heart, who clung to
him fainting and crying weakly. What men had
done to him, he could shake off. They had not
hurt him. He could still defy them. But what
they had done to his little mother, that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
rankle and turn in his heart forever. He would
never forgive them for the things they had done
to her in these four weeks and in these two days.</p>
<p>And here at his elbow stood the one person who
had to-day done more to hurt his mother and himself
than any other in the world could have done.
She could have told his mother weeks ago, and
have saved her all that racking sorrow and anxiety.
But no, for the sake of that religion of hers, for
the sake of what some priest told her, she had
stuck to what had turned out to be a useless lie,
to save a dead man&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Ruth stood there reaching out her hands to him.
But he turned upon her with a look of savage,
fleering contempt; a look that stunned the girl as
a blow in the face would have done. Then in a
strange, hard voice he said brutally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth dropped her eyes pitifully under the shock
of his look and words. Even now she could not
speak, could not appeal to his reason, could not
tell him that she had heard nothing but what had
come under the awful seal of the confessional.
The secret was out. She had risked his life and
lost his love to guard that secret, and now the
world knew it. All the world could talk freely
about what she had done except only herself.
Even if she could have reached up and drawn his
head down to her lips, even then she could not so
much as whisper into his ear that he was right, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
try to tell him why she had not been able to
speak. She saw the secret standing forever between
their two lives, unacknowledged, embittering
both those lives, yet impassable as the line of
death.</p>
<p>When she looked up, he was gone out to his
freedom in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The hill people were jammed about the door
and in the street as he came out. Twenty hands
reached forward to grasp him, to draw him into
the midst of their crowd, to mount him upon his
own horse which they had caught wandering in
the high hills and had brought down for him.
They were happy, triumphant and loud, for them&ndash;&ndash;the
hill people were not much given to noise or
demonstration. But under their triumph and their
noise there was a current of haste and anxious eagerness
which he was quick to notice.</p>
<p>During the weeks in jail, when his own fate had
absorbed most of his waking moments, he had let
slip from him the thought of the battle that yet
must be waged in the hills. Now, among his people
again, and once more their unquestioned
leader, his mind went back with a click into the
grooves in which it had been working so long.
He pushed his horse forward and led the men at
a gallop over the Racquette bridge and out toward
the hills, the families who had come down from
the nearer hills in wagons stringing along behind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>When they were well clear of the town, he
halted and demanded the full news of the last four
weeks.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that while this account
of these happenings has been obliged to turn aside
here and there, following the vicissitudes and doings
of individuals, the railroad powers had never
for a moment turned a step aside from the single,
unemotional course upon which they had set out.
Orders had gone out that the railroad must get
title to the strip of hill country forty miles wide
lying along the right of way. These orders must
be executed. The titles must be gotten. Failures
or successes here or there were of no account.
The incidents made use of or the methods employed
were of importance only as they contributed
to the general result.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting had blocked the plans once.
That was nothing. There were other plans.
The Shepherd of the North before the Senate
committee had blocked another set of plans.
That was merely an obstacle to be gone around.
The railroad people had gone around it by procuring
the burning of the country. The people, left
homeless for the most part and well-nigh ruined,
would be glad now to take anything they could
get for their lands. There had been no vindictiveness,
no animus on the part of the railroad.
Its programme had been as impersonal and detached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
as the details in any business transaction.
Certain aims were to be accomplished. The
means were purely incidental.</p>
<p>Rogers, whom the railroad had first used as an
agent and afterwards as an instrument, was now
gone&ndash;&ndash;a broken tool. Rafe Gadbeau, who had
been Rogers&rsquo; assistant, was gone&ndash;&ndash;another broken
tool. The fire had been used for its purpose.
The fire was a thing of the past. Jeffrey Whiting
had been put out of the way&ndash;&ndash;definitely, the railroad
had hoped. He was now free again to make
difficulties. All these things were but changes
and moves and temporary checks in the carrying
through of the business. In the end the railroad
must attain its end.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting saw all these things as he sat
his horse on the old Piercefield road and listened
to what had been happening in the hills during the
four weeks of his removal from the scene.</p>
<p>The fire, because it had seemed the end of all
things to the people of the hills, had put out of
their minds all thought of what the railroad would
do next. Now they were realising that the railroad
had moved right on about its purpose in the
wake of the fire. It had learned instantly of Rogers&rsquo;
death and had instantly set to work to use that
as a means of removing Jeffrey Whiting from its
path. But that was only a side line of activity.
It had gone right on with its main business.
Other men had been sent at once into the hills with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
what seemed like liberal offers for six-month
options on all the lands which the railroad
coveted.</p>
<p>They had gotten hold of discouraged families
who had not yet begun to rebuild. The offer of
any little money was welcome to these. The
whole people were disorganised and demoralised
as a result of the scattering which the fire had
forced upon them. They were not sure that it
was worth while to rebuild in the hills. The fire
had burned through the thin soil in many places
so that the land would be useless for farming for
many years to come. They had no leader, and
the fact that Jeffrey Whiting was in jail charged
with murder, and, as they heard, likely to be convicted,
forced upon them the feeling that the railroad
would win in the end. Where was the use
to struggle against an enemy they could not see
and who could not be hurt by anything they might
do?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting saw that the fight which had
gone before, to keep the people in line and prevent
them from signing enough options to suit the railroad&rsquo;s
purpose, had been easy in comparison with
the one that was now before him. The people
were disheartened. They had begun to fear the
mysterious, unassailable power of the railroad. It
was an enemy of a kind to which their lives and
training had not accustomed them. It struck in
the dark, and no man&rsquo;s hand could be raised to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
punish. It hid itself behind an illusive veil of law
and a bulwark of officials.</p>
<p>The people were for the large part still homeless.
Many were still down in the villages, living
upon neighbourhood kindness and the scant help
of public charity. Only the comparative few who
could obtain ready credit had been able even to
begin rebuilding. If they were not roused to
prodigious efforts at once, the winter would be
upon them before the hills were resettled. And
with the coming of the pinch of winter men would
be ready to sell anything upon which they had a
claim, for the mere privilege of living.</p>
<p>When they came up into the burnt country, the
bitterness which had been boiling up in his heart
through those weeks and which he had thought
had risen to its full height during the scenes of to-day
now ran over completely. His heart raved
in an agony of impotent anger and a thirst for revenge.
His life had been in danger. Gladly
would he now put it ten times in danger for the
power to strike one free, crushing blow at this insolent
enemy. He would grapple with it, die with
it only for the power to bring it to the ground
with himself!</p>
<p>The others had become accustomed to the look
of the country, but the full desolation of it broke
upon his eyes now for the first time. The hills
that should have glowed in their wonderful russets
from the red sun going down in the west,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
were nothing but streaked ash heaps, where the
rain had run down in gullies. The valleys between,
where the autumn greens should have run
deep and fresh, where snug homes should have
stood, where happy people should now be living,
were nothing but blackened hollows of destitution.
From Bald Mountain, away up on the east, to far,
low-lying Old Forge to the south, nothing but a
circle of ashes. Ashes and bitterness in the
mouth; dirt and ashes in the eye; misery and the
food of hate in the heart!</p>
<p>Very late in the night they came to French Village.
The people here were still practically living
in the barrack which the Bishop had seen built,
the women and children sleeping in it, the men
finding what shelter they could in the new houses
that were going up. There were enough of these
latter to show that French Village would live
again, for the notes which the Bishop had endorsed
had carried credit and good faith to men
who were judges of paper on which men&rsquo;s names
were written and they had brought back supplies
of all that was strictly needful.</p>
<p>Here was food and water for man and beast.
Men roused themselves from sleep to cheer the
young Whiting and to hobble the horses out and
feed them. And shrill, voluminous women came
forth to get food for the men and to wave hands
and skillets wildly over the story of Cynthe
Cardinal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>The mention of the girl&rsquo;s name brought things
back to Jeffrey Whiting. Till now he had hardly
given a thought to the girl who, by a terrible sacrifice
of the man she loved, had saved him. He
owed that girl a great deal. And the thought
brought to his mind another girl. He struck himself
viciously across the eyes as though he would
crush the memory, and went out to tramp among
the ashes till the dawn. His body had no need of
rest, for the exercise he had taken to-day had
merely served to throw off the lethargy of the jail;
and sleep was beyond him.</p>
<p>At the first light he roused the hill men and told
them what the night had told him. Unless they
struck one desperate, destroying blow at the railroad,
it would come up mile by mile and farm by
farm and take from them the little that was left
to them. They had been fools that they had not
struck in the beginning when they had first found
that they were being played falsely. If they had
begun to fight in the early summer their homes
would not have been burned and they would not
be now facing the cold and hunger of an unsheltered,
unprovided winter.</p>
<p>Why had they not struck? Because they were
afraid? No. They had not struck because their
fathers had taught them a fear and respect of the
law. They had depended upon law. And here
was law for them: the hills in ashes, their families
scattered and going hungry!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>If no man would go with him, he would ride
alone down to the end of the rails and sell his life
singly to drive back the work as far as he could,
to rouse the hill people to fight for themselves and
their own.</p>
<p>If ten men would come with him they could
drive back the workmen for days, days in which
the hill people would come rallying back into the
hills to them. The people were giving up in
despair because nothing was being done. Show
them that even ten men were ready to fight for
them and their rights and they would come
trooping back, eager to fight and to hold their
homes. There was yet wealth in the hills. If
the railroad was willing to fight and to defy law
and right to get it, were there not men in the
hills who would fight for it because it was their
own?</p>
<p>If fifty men would come with him they could
destroy the railroad clear down below the line of
the hills and put the work back for months.
They would have sheriffs&rsquo; posses out against them.
They would have to fight with hired fighters that
the railroad would bring up against them. In the
end they would perhaps have to fight the State
militia, but there were men among them, he
shouted, who had fought more than militia.
Would they not dare face it now for their homes
and their people!</p>
<p>Some men would die. But some men always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
died, in every cause. And in the end the people
of the whole State would judge the cause!</p>
<p>Would one man come? Would ten? Would
fifty?</p>
<p>Seventy-two grim, sullen men looked over the
knobs and valleys of ashes where their homes had
been, took what food the French people could
spare them, and mounted silently behind him.</p>
<p>Up over the ashes of Leyden road, past the cellars
of the homes of many of them, for half the
day they rode, saving every strain they could upon
their horses. A three-hour rest. Then over the
southern divide and down the slope they thundered
to strike the railroad at Leavit&rsquo;s bridge.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='IX_THE_COMING_OF_THE_SHEPHERD' id='IX_THE_COMING_OF_THE_SHEPHERD'></a>
<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>THE COMING OF THE SHEPHERD</h3>
</div>
<p>The wires coming down from the north were
flashing the railroad&rsquo;s call for help. A band of
madmen had struck the end of the line at Leavit&rsquo;s
Creek and had destroyed the half-finished bridge.
They had raced down the line, driving the frightened
labourers before them, tearing up the ties and
making huge fires of them on which they threw
the new rails, heating and twisting these beyond
any hope of future usefulness.</p>
<p>Labourers, foremen and engineers of construction
had fled literally for their lives. The men
of the hills had no quarrel with them. They preferred
not to injure them. But they were infuriated
men with their wrongs fresh in mind and
with deadly hunting rifles in hand. The workmen
on the line needed no second warning. They
would take no chances with an enemy of this kind.
They were used to violence and rioting in their own
labour troubles, but this was different. This was
war. They threw themselves headlong upon
handcars and work engines and bolted down the
line, carrying panic before them.</p>
<p>In a single night the hill men with Jeffrey Whiting
at their head had ridden down and destroyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
nearly twenty miles of very costly construction
work. There were yet thirty miles of the line left
in the hills and if the men were not stopped they
would not leave a single rail in all the hill country
where they were masters.</p>
<p>The call of the railroad was at first frantic with
panic and fright. That was while little men who
had lost their wits were nominally in charge of a
situation in which nobody knew what to do.
Then suddenly the tone of the railroad&rsquo;s call
changed. Big men, used to meeting all sorts of
things quickly and efficiently, had taken hold.
They had the telegraph lines of the State in their
hands. There was no more frightened appeal.
Orders were snapped over the wires to sheriffs in
Adirondack and Tupper and Alexander counties.
They were told to swear in as many deputies as
they could lead. They were to forget the consideration
of expense. The railroad would pay and
feed the men. They were to think of nothing but
to get the greatest possible number of fighting men
upon the line at once.</p>
<p>Then a single great man, a man who sat in a
great office building in New York and held his
hand upon every activity in the State, saw the gravity
of the business in the hills and put himself to
work upon it. He took no half measures. He
had no faith in little local authorities, who would
be bound to sympathise somewhat with the hill
people in this battle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>He called the Governor of the State from Albany
to his office. He ordered the Governor to
turn out the State&rsquo;s armed forces and set them in
motion toward the hills. He wondered autocratically
that the Governor had not had the sense
to do this of himself. The Governor bridled and
hesitated. The Governor had been living on the
fiction that he was the executive head of the State.
It took Clifford W. Stanton just three minutes to
disabuse him completely and forever of this illusion.
He explained to him just why he was Governor
and by whose permission. Also he pointed
out that the permission of the great railroad system
that covered the State would again be necessary
in order that Governor Foster might succeed
himself. Then the great man sent Wilbur Foster
back to Albany to order out the nearest regiment
of the National Guard for service in the hills.</p>
<p>Before the second night three companies of the
militia had passed through Utica and had gone up
the line of the U. &amp; M. Their orders were to
avoid killing where possible and to capture all of
the hill men that they could. The railroad wished
to have them tried and imprisoned by the impartial
law of the land. For it was characteristic of the
great power which in those days ruled the State
that when it had outraged every sense of fair play
and common humanity to attain its ends it was then
ready to spend much money creating public opinion
in favour of itself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting stood in the evening in the
cover of the woods above Milton&rsquo;s Crossing and
watched a train load of soldiers on flat cars come
creeping up the grade from the south. This was
the last of the hills. He had refused to let his
men go farther. Behind him lay fifty miles of
new railroad in ruins. Before him lay the open,
settled country. His men, once the fever of destruction
had begun to run in their blood, had
wished to sweep on down into the villages and
carry their work through them. But he had stood
firm. This was their own country where they belonged
and where the railroad was the interloper.
Here they were at home. Here there was a certain
measure of safety for them even in the destructive
and lawless work that they had begun.
They had done enough. They had pushed the
railroad back to the edge of the hills. They had
roused the men of the hills behind them. Where
he had started with his seventy-two friends, there
were now three hundred well-armed men in the
woods around him. Here in their cover they
could hold the line of the railroad indefinitely
against almost any force that might be sent against
them.</p>
<p>But the inevitable sobering sense of leadership
and responsibility was already at work upon him.
The burning, rankling anger that had driven him
onward so that he had carried everything and
everybody near him into this business of destruction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
was now dulled down to a slow, dull hate that
while it had lost nothing of its bitterness yet gave
him time to think. Those men coming up there
on the cars were not professional soldiers, paid
to fight wherever there was fighting to be done.
Neither did they care anything for the railroad
that they should come up here to fight for it.
Why did they come?</p>
<p>They had joined their organisation for various
reasons that usually had very little to do with fighting.
They were clerks and office men, for the
most part, from the villages and factories of the
central part of the State. The militia companies
had attracted them because the armouries in the
towns had social advantages to offer, because uniforms
and parade appeal to all boys, because they
were sons of veterans and the military tradition
was strong in them. Jeffrey Whiting&rsquo;s strong
natural sense told him the substance of these
things. He could not regard these boys as deadly
enemies to be shot down without mercy or warning.
They had taken their arms at a word of command
and had come up here to uphold the arm of
the State. If the railroad was able to control the
politics of the State and so was able to send these
boys up here on its own business, then other people
were to blame for the situation. Certainly these
boys, coming up here to do nothing but what their
duty to the State compelled them to do; they were
not to be blamed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>His men were now urging him to withdraw a
little distance into the hills to where the bed of the
road ran through a defile between two hills. The
soldiers would no doubt advance directly up the
line of what had been the railroad, covering the
workmen and engineers who would be coming on
behind them. If they were allowed to go on up
into the defile without warning or opposition they
could be shot down by the hill men from almost absolute
safety. If he had been dealing with a hated
enemy Jeffrey Whiting perhaps could have agreed
to that. But to shoot down from ambush these
boys, who had come up here many of them probably
thinking they were coming to a sort of picnic
or outing in the September woods, was a thing
which he could not contemplate. Before he would
attack them these boys must know just what they
were to expect.</p>
<p>He saw them leave the cars at the end of the
broken line and take up their march in a rough
column of fours along the roadbed. He was surprised
and puzzled. He had expected them to
work along the line only as fast as the men repaired
the rails behind them. He had not thought
that they would go away from their cars.</p>
<p>Then he understood. They were not coming
merely to protect the rebuilding of the railroad.
They had their orders to come straight into the
hills, to attack and capture him and his men. The
railroad was not only able to call the State to protect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
itself. It had called upon the State to avenge
its wrongs, to exterminate its enemies. His men
had understood this better than he. Probably
they were right. This thing might as well be
fought out from the first. In the end there would
be no quarter. They could defeat this handful of
troops and drive them back out of the hills with
an ease that would be almost ridiculous. But that
would not be the end.</p>
<p>The State would send other men, unlimited
numbers of them, for it must and would uphold
the authority of its law. Jeffrey Whiting did
not deceive himself. Probably he had not from
the beginning had any doubt as to what would be
the outcome of this raid upon the railroad. The
railroad itself had broken the law of the State
and the law of humanity. It had defied every
principle of justice and common decency. It had
burned the homes of law-supporting, good men in
the hills. Yet the law had not raised a hand to
punish it. But now when the railroad itself had
suffered, the whole might of the State was ready to
be set in motion to punish the men of the hills
who had merely paid their debt.</p>
<p>But Jeffrey Whiting could not say to himself
that he had not foreseen all this from the outset.
Those days of thinking in jail had given him an
insight into realities that years of growth and observation
of things outside might not have produced
in him. He had been given time to see that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
some things are insurmountable, that things may
be wrong and unsound and utterly unjust and still
persist and go on indefinitely. Youth does not
readily admit this. Jeffrey Whiting had recognised
it as a fact. And yet, knowing this, he had
led these men, his friends, men who trusted him,
upon this mad raid. They had come without the
clear vision of the end which he now realised had
been his from the start. They had thought that
they could accomplish something, that they had
some chance of winning a victory over the railroad.
They had believed that the power of the
State would intervene to settle the differences between
them and their enemy. Jeffrey Whiting
knew, must have known all along, that the moment
a tie was torn up on the railroad the whole strength
of the State would be put forth to capture these
men and punish them. There would be no compromise.
There would be no bargaining. If
they surrendered and gave themselves up now they
would be jailed for varying terms. If they did
not, if they stayed here and fought, some of them
would be killed and injured and in one way or another
all would suffer in the end.</p>
<p>He had done them a cruel wrong. The truth
of this struck him with startling clearness now.
He had led them into this without letting them see
the full extent of what they were doing, as he must
have seen it.</p>
<p>There was but one thing to do. If they dispersed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
now and scattered themselves through the
hills few of them would ever be identified. And
if he went down and surrendered alone the railroad
would be almost satisfied with punishing him.
It was the one just and right thing to do.</p>
<p>He went swiftly among the men where they
stood among the trees, waiting with poised rifles
for the word to fire upon the advancing soldiers,
and told them what they must do. He had deceived
them. He had not told them the whole
truth as he himself knew it. They must leave at
once, scattering up among the hills and keeping
close mouths as to where they had been and what
they had done. He would go down and give himself
up, for if the railroad people once had him in
custody they would not bother so very much about
bringing the others to punishment.</p>
<p>His men looked at him in a sort of puzzled wonder.
They did not understand, unless it might be
that he had suddenly gone crazy. There was an
enemy marching up the line toward them, bent
upon killing or capturing them. They turned
from him and without a spoken word, without a
signal of any sort, loosed a rifle volley across the
front of the oncoming troops. The battle was
on!</p>
<p>The volley had been fired by men who were accustomed
to shoot deer and foxes from distances
greater than this. The first two ranks of the
soldiers fell as if they had been cut down with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
scythes. Not one of them was hit above the
knees. The firing stopped suddenly as it had begun.
The hill men had given a terse, emphatic
warning. It was as though they had marked a
dead line beyond which there must be no advance.</p>
<p>These soldiers had never before been shot at.
The very restraint which the hill men had shown
in not killing any of them in that volley proved
to the soldiers even in their fright and surprise
how deadly was the aim and the judgment of the
invisible enemy somewhere in the woods there before
them. To their credit, they did not drop
their arms or run. They stood stunned and
paralysed, as much by the suddenness with which
the firing had ceased as by the surprise of its beginning.</p>
<p>Their officers ran forward, shouting the superfluous
command for them to halt, and ordering
them to carry the wounded men back to the cars.
For a moment it seemed doubtful whether they
would again advance or would put themselves into
some kind of defence formation and hold the
ground on which they stood.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting, looking beyond them, saw two
other trains come slowly creeping up the line.
From the second train he saw men leaping down
who did not take up any sort of military formation.
These he knew were sheriffs&rsquo; posses, fighting
men sworn in because they were known to be
fighters. They were natural man hunters who delighted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
in the chase of the human animal. He had
often seen them in the hills on the hunt, and he
knew that they were an enemy of a character far
different from those harmless boys who could not
hit a mark smaller than the side of a hill. These
men would follow doggedly, persistently into the
highest of the hills, saving themselves, but never
letting the prey slip from their sight, dividing the
hill men, separating them, cornering them until
they should have tracked them down one by one
and either captured or killed them all.</p>
<p>These men did not attempt to advance along the
line of the road. They stepped quickly out into
the undergrowth and began spreading a thin line
of men to either side.</p>
<p>Then he saw that the third train, although they
were soldiers, took their lesson from the men who
had just preceded them. They left the tracks
and spreading still farther out took up the wings
of a long line that was now stretching east to west
along the fringe of the hills. The soldiers in the
centre retired a little way down the roadbed, stood
bunched together for a little time while their officers
evidently conferred together, then left the
road by twos and fours and began spreading out
and pushing the other lines out still farther. It
was perfect and systematic work, he agreed, that
could not have been better done if he and his companions
had planned it for their own capture.</p>
<p>There were easily eight hundred men there in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
front, he judged; men well armed and ready for
an indefinite stay in the hills, with a railroad at
their back to bring up supplies, and with the entire
State behind them. And the State was ready to
send more and more men after these if it should be
necessary. He had no doubt that hundreds of
other men were being held in readiness to follow
these or were perhaps already on their way. He
saw the end.</p>
<p>Those lines would sweep up slowly, remorselessly
and surround his men. If they stood together
they would be massacred. If they separated
they would be hunted down one by one.</p>
<p>Their only chance was to scatter at once and
ride back to where their homes had been. This
time he implored them to take their chance,
begged them to save themselves while they could.
But he might have known that they would do nothing
of the kind. Already they were breaking
away and spreading out to meet that distending
line in front of them. Nothing short of a miracle
could now save them from annihilation, and
Jeffrey Whiting was not expecting a miracle.
There was nothing to be done but to take command
and sell his life along with theirs as dearly
as possible.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The echoes of the outbreak in the hills ran up
and down the State. Men who had followed the
course of things through the past months, men who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
knew the spoken story of the fire in the hills which
no newspaper had dared to print openly, understood
just what it meant. The men up there had
been goaded to desperation at last. But wise men
agreed quietly with each other that they had done
the very worst thing that could have been done.
The injury they had done the railroad would
amount to very little, comparatively, in the end,
while it would give the railroad an absolutely free
hand from now on. The people would be driven
forever out of the lands which the railroad wished
to possess. There would be no legislative hindrances
now. The people had doomed themselves.</p>
<p>The echoes reached also to two million other
men throughout the State who did not understand
the matter in the least. These looked up a moment
from the work of living and earning a living
to sympathise vaguely with the foolish men up
there in the hills who had attacked the sacred and
awful rights of railroad property. It was too bad.
Maybe there were some rights somewhere in the
case. But who could tell? And the two million,
the rulers and sovereigns of the State, went back
again to their business.</p>
<p>The echo came to Joseph Winthrop, Bishop of
Alden, almost before a blow had been struck. It
is hardly too much to say that he was listening for
it. He knew his people, kindly, lagging of speech,
slow to anger; but, once past a certain point of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
aggravation, absolutely heedless and reckless of
consequences.</p>
<p>He did not stop to compute just how much he
himself was bound up in the causes and consequences
of what had happened and what was happening
in the hills. He had given advice. He
had thought with the people and only for the
people.</p>
<p>He saw, long before it was told him in words,
the wild ride down through the hills to strike the
railroad, the fury of destruction, the gathering
of the forces of the State to punish.</p>
<p>Here was no time for self-examination or self-judgment.
Wherein Joseph Winthrop had done
well, or had failed, or had done wrong, was of no
moment now.</p>
<p>One man there was in all the State, in all the
nation, who could give the word that would now
save the people of the hills. Clifford W. Stanton
who had sat months ago in his office in New York
and had set all these things going, whose ruthless
hand was to be recognised in every act of those
which had driven the people to this madness, his
will and his alone could stay the storm that was
now raging in the hills.</p>
<p>Once the Bishop had seen that man do an act
of supreme and unselfish bravery. It was an act
of both physical and moral courage the like of
which the Bishop had never witnessed. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
an act which had revealed in Clifford W. Stanton
a depth of strong fineness that no man would have
suspected. It was done in the dim, dead time of
faraway youth, but the Bishop had not forgotten.
And he knew that men do not rise to such heights
without having very deep in them the nobility to
make it possible and at times inevitable that they
should rise to those heights.</p>
<p>After these years and the encrusting strata of
compromise and cowardice and selfishness which
years and life lay upon the fresh heart of the youth
of men, could that depth of nobility in the soul of
Clifford W. Stanton again be touched?</p>
<p>Almost before the forces of the State were in
motion against the people of the hills, the Bishop,
early of a morning, walked into the office of Clifford
Stanton.</p>
<p>Stanton was a smaller man than the Bishop, and
though younger than the latter by some half-dozen
years, it was evident that he had burned up the fuel
of life more rapidly. Where the Bishop looked
and spoke and moved with the deliberate fixity of
the settling years, Stanton acted with a quick nervousness
that shook just a perceptible little. The
spiritual strength of restraint and inward thinking
which had chiselled the Bishop&rsquo;s face into a single,
simple expression of will power was not to be
found in the other&rsquo;s face. In its stead there was
a certain steel-trap impression, as though the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
behind the face had all his life refused to be certain
of anything until the jaws of the trap had set upon
the accomplished fact.</p>
<p>Physically the two men were much of a type.
You would have known them anywhere for New
Englanders of the generation that has disappeared
almost completely in the last twenty years. They
had been boys at Harvard together, though not of
the same class. They had been together in the
Civil War, though the nature of their services had
been infinitely diverse. They had met here and
there casually and incidentally in the business of
life. But they faced each other now virtually as
strangers, and with a certain tightening grip upon
himself each man realised that he was about to
grapple with one of the strongest willed men that
he had ever met, and that he must test out the
other man to the depths and be himself tried out
to the limit of his strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is some years since I&rsquo;ve seen you, Bishop.
But we are both busy men. And&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash; You
know I am glad to have you come to see me.
I need not tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop accepted the other man&rsquo;s frank
courtesy and took a chair quietly. Stanton
watched him carefully. The Bishop was showing
the last few years a good deal, he thought. In
reality it was the last month that the Bishop was
showing. But it did not show in the steady, untroubled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
glow of his eyes. The Bishop wasted no
time on preliminaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come on business, of course, Mr.
Stanton,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;It is a very strange and
unusual business. And to come at it rightly I
must tell you a story. At the end of the story I
will ask you a question. That will be my whole
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man said nothing. He did not understand
and he never spoke until he was sure that
he understood. The Bishop plunged into his
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One January day in &lsquo;Sixty-five&rsquo; I was going
up the Shenandoah alone. My command had left
me behind for two days of hospital service at Cross
Keys. They were probably some twenty miles
ahead of me and would be crossing over the divide
towards Five Forks and the east. I thought I
knew a way by which I could cut off a good part of
the distance that separated me from them, so I
started across the Ridge by a path which would
have been impossible for troops in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was right. I did cut off the distance which
I had expected and came down in the early afternoon
upon a good road that ran up the eastern side
of the Ridge. I was just congratulating myself
that I would be with my men before dark, when
a troop of Confederate cavalry came pelting over
a rise in the road behind me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I leaped my horse back into the brush at the
side of the road and waited. They would sweep
on past and allow me to go on my way. Behind
them came a troop of our own horse pursuing
hotly. The Confederate horses were well spent.
I saw that the end of the pursuit was not far off.
The Confederates&ndash;&ndash;some detached band of
Early&rsquo;s men, I imagine&ndash;&ndash;realised that they would
soon be run down. Just where I had left the road
there was a sharp turn. Here the Confederates
threw themselves from their horses and drew
themselves across the road. They were in perfect
ambush, for they could be seen scarcely fifteen
yards back on the narrow road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I broke from the bush and fled back along the
road to warn our men. But I did no good.
They were beyond all stopping, or hearing even,
as they came yelling around the turn of the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three minutes there was some of the
sharpest fighting I ever saw, there in the narrow
road, before what remained of the Confederates
broke after their horses and made off again. In
the very middle of the fight I noticed two young
officers. One was a captain, the other a lieutenant.
I knew them. I knew their story. I
believe I was the only man living who knew that
story. Probably <i>I</i> did not know the whole of
that story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lieutenant had maligned the captain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
He had said of him the one thing that a soldier
may not say of another. They had fought once.
Why they had been kept in the same command I
do not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now in the very hottest of this fight, without
apparently the slightest warning, the lieutenant
threw himself upon the captain, attacking
him viciously with his sword. For a moment
they struggled there, unnoticed in the dust of the
conflict. Then the captain, swinging free, struck
the lieutenant&rsquo;s sword from his hand. The latter
drew his pistol and fired, point blank. It
missed. By what miracle I do not know. All
this time the captain had held his sword poised to
lunge, within easy striking distance of the other&rsquo;s
throat. But he had made no attempt to thrust.
As the pistol missed I saw him stiffen his arm to
strike. Instead he looked a long moment into
the lieutenant&rsquo;s eyes. The latter was screaming
what were evidently taunts into his face. The
captain dropped his arm, wheeled, and plunged at
the now breaking line of Confederates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen brave men kill bravely. I have
seen brave men bravely refrain from killing.
That was the bravest thing I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford Stanton sat staring directly in front of
him. He gave no sign of hearing. He was living
over for himself that scene on a lonely, forgotten
Virginia road. At last he said as to himself:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The lieutenant died, a soldier&rsquo;s death, the
next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; said the Bishop quietly. &ldquo;My
question is: Are you the same brave man with
a soldier&rsquo;s brave, great heart that you were that
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time Clifford Stanton sat staring
directly at something that was not in the visible
world. The question had sprung upon him out
of the dead past. What right had this man, what
right had any man to face him with it?</p>
<p>He wheeled savagely upon the Bishop:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sat by the roadside and got a glimpse of
the tragedy of my life as it whirled by you on
the road! How dare you come here to tell me the
little bit of it you saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the Bishop swiftly, &ldquo;you have
forgotten how great and brave a man you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanton stared uncomprehendingly at him. He
was stirred to the depths of feelings that he had
not known for years. But even in his emotion
and bewilderment the steel trap of silence set
upon his face. His lifetime of never speaking
until he knew what he was going to say kept him
waiting to hear more. It was not any conscious
caution; it was merely the instinct of self-defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For months,&rdquo; the Bishop was going on
quietly, &ldquo;the people of my hills have been harassed
by you in your unfair efforts to get possession
of the lands upon which their fathers built
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
their homes. You have tried to cheat them.
You have sent men to lie to them. You tried to
debauch a legislature in your attempt to overcome
them. I have here in my pocket the sworn
confessions of two men who stood in the shadow
of death and said that they had been sent to burn
a whole countryside that you and your associates
coveted&ndash;&ndash;to burn the people in their homes like
the meadow birds in their nests. I can trace that
act to within two men of you. And I can sit here,
Clifford Stanton, and look you in the eye man to
man and tell you that I <i>know</i> you gave the suggestion.
And you cannot look back and deny it.
I cannot take you into a court of law in this State
and prove it. We both know the futility of talking
of that. But I can take you, I do take you
this minute into the court of your own heart&ndash;&ndash;where
I know a brave man lives&ndash;&ndash;and convict
you of this thing. You know it. I know it. If
the whole world stood here accusing you would
we know it any the better?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my people have made a terrible mistake.
They have taken the law into their own hands and
have thought to punish you themselves. They
have done wrong, they have done foolishly.
Who can punish you? You have power above the
law. Your interests are above the courts of the
land. They did not understand. They did not
know you. They have been misled. They have
listened to men like me preaching: &lsquo;Right shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
prevail: Justice shall conquer.&rsquo; And where
does right prevail? And when shall justice conquer?
No doubt you have said these phrases
yourself. Because your fathers and my fathers
taught us to say them. But are they true? Does
justice conquer? Does right prevail? You can
say. I ask you, who have the answer in your
power. Does right prevail? Then give my
stricken people what is theirs. Does justice conquer?
Then see that they come to no harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare to put this thing raw to your face because
I know the man that once lived within you.
I saw you&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harp on that,&rdquo; Stanton cut in viciously.
&ldquo;You know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> harp on that. I have come here to
harp on that. Do you think that if I had not
with my eyes seen that thing I would have come
near you at all? No. I would have branded
you before all men for the thing that you have
done. I would have given these confessions
which I hold to the world. I would have denounced
you as far as tongue and pen would go
to every man who through four years gave blood
at your side. I would have braved the rebuke
of my superiors and maybe the discipline of my
Church to bring upon you the hard thoughts of
men. I would have made your name hated in
the ears of little children. But I would not have
come to you.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If I had not seen that thing I would not have
come to you, for I would have said: What
good? The man is a coward without a heart.
A <i>coward</i>, do you remember that word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man groaned and struck out with his hand
as though to drive away a ghastly thing that would
leap upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coward without a heart,&rdquo; the Bishop repeated
remorselessly, &ldquo;who has men and women
and children in his power and who, because he has
no heart, can use his power to crush them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had not seen, I would have said that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw. I <i>saw</i>. And I have come here
to ask you: Are you the same brave man with a
heart that I saw on that day?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not evade me. Do you think you
can put me off with defences and puling arguments
of necessity, or policy, or the sacredness of
property? No. You and I are here looking at
naked truth. I will go down into your very soul
and have it out by the roots, the naked truth.
But I will have my answer. Are you that same
man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are not that same man; if you have
killed that in you which gave life to that man;
if that man no longer lives in you; if you are not
capable of being that same man with the heart
of a great and tender hero, then tell me and I
will go. But you shall answer me. I will have
my answer.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>Clifford Stanton rose heavily from his chair
and stood trembling as though in an overpowering
rage, and visibly struggling for his command
of mind and tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words, words, words,&rdquo; he groaned at last.
&ldquo;Your life is made of words. Words are your
coin. What do you know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that words can go down into
my soul to find the man that was once there? Do
you think that words can call him up? When
did words ever mean anything to a man&rsquo;s real
heart! You come here with your question. It&rsquo;s
made of words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did men ever do anything for <i>words</i>?
Honour is a word. Truth is a word. Bravery
is a word. Loyalty is a word. Hero is a word.
Do you think men do things for words? No!
What do you know? What <i>could</i> you know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men do things and you call them by words.
But do they do them for the words? No!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do them&ndash;&ndash; Because <i>some woman
lives, or once lived!</i> What do <i>you</i> know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out there. Stay there.&rdquo; He pointed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell brokenly into his chair and lay against
his desk. The Bishop rose and walked from the
room.</p>
<p>When he heard the door close, the man got up
and going to the door barred it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>He came back and sat awhile, his head leaning
heavily upon his propped hands.</p>
<p>He opened a drawer of his desk and looked
at a smooth, glinting black and steel thing that
lay there. Then he shut the drawer with a bang
that went out to the Bishop listening in the
outer office. It was a sinister, suggestive noise,
and for an instant it chilled that good man&rsquo;s
heart. But his ears were sharp and true and he
knew immediately that he had been mistaken.</p>
<p>Stanton pulled out another drawer, unlocked
a smaller compartment within it, and from the
latter took a small gold-framed picture. He set
it up on the desk between his hands and looked
long at it, questioning the face in the frame with
a tender, diffident expression of a wonder that
never ceased, of a longing never to be stilled.</p>
<p>The face that looked out of the picture was
one of a quiet, translucent beauty. At first
glance the face had none of the striking features
that men associate with great beauty. But behind
the eyes there seemed to glow, and to grow
gradually, and softly stronger, a light, as though
diffused within an alabaster vase, that slowly radiated
from the whole countenance an impression of
indescribable, gentle loveliness.</p>
<p>Clifford Stanton had often wondered what was
that light from within. He wondered now, and
questioned. Never before had that light seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
so wonderful and so real. Now there came to
him an answer. An answer that shook him, for
it was the last answer he would have expected.
The light within was truth&ndash;&ndash;truth. It seemed
that in a world of sham and illusions and evasions
this one woman had understood, had lived with
truth.</p>
<p>The man laughed. A low, mirthless, dry
laugh that was nearer to a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that it, Lucy?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Truth?
Then let us have a little truth, for once! I&rsquo;ll tell
you some truth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lied a while ago. He did <i>not</i> die a soldier&rsquo;s
death. I told the same lie to you long ago.
Words. Words. And yet you went to Heaven
happy because I lied to you and kept on lying to
you. Words. And yet you died a happy woman,
because of that lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lied to you. He took you from me with
lies. Words. Lies. And yet they made you
happy. Where is truth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lived happy and died happy with a lie.
Because I lied like what they call a man and a
gentleman. <i>Truth!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked searchingly, wonderingly at the face
before him. Did he expect to see the light fade
out, to see the face wither under the bitter
revelation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been everything,&rdquo; he went on, still trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
to make his point, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done everything,
that men say I&rsquo;ve been and done. Why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;Why?&rdquo; he asked sharply. &ldquo;Did
it make any difference?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard, grasping, tricky, men call me that to my
face&ndash;&ndash;sometimes. Well&ndash;&ndash;Why not? Does
it make any difference? Did it make any difference
with you? If I had thought it would&ndash;&ndash; But
it didn&rsquo;t. Lies, trickery, words! They
served with you. They made you happy.
<i>Truth!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as he looked into the face and the smiling
light of truth persisted in it, there came over
his soul the dawn of a wonder. And the dawn
glowed within him, so that it came to his eyes and
looked out wondering at a world remade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Lucy?&rdquo; he asked gently. &ldquo;Can
that be <i>truth</i>, at last? Is that what you mean?
Did you, deep down, somewhere beneath words
and beneath thoughts, did you, did you really understand&ndash;&ndash;a
little? And do you, somewhere,
understand now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me. Was it worth the lies?
Down underneath, when you understood, which
was the truth? The thing I did&ndash;&ndash;which men
would call fine? Or was it the words?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that it? Is that the truth, Lucy? Was
it the fine thing that was really the truth, and
did you, do you, know it, after all? Is there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
truth that lives deep down, and did you, who were
made of truth, did you somehow understand all
the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat awhile, wondering, questioning; finally
believing. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy, a man out there wants his answer. I
will not speak it to him. But I&rsquo;ll say it to you:
Yes, I am that same man who once did what they
call a fine, brave thing. I didn&rsquo;t do it because
it was a great thing, a brave thing. I did it for
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll do this for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked again at the face in the picture, as
if to make sure. Then he locked it away quickly
in its place.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment, then drew a pad
abruptly to him and began writing. He wrote
two telegrams, one to the Governor of the State,
the other to the Sheriff of Tupper County. Then
he took another pad and wrote a note, this to his
personal representative who was following the
state troops into the hills.</p>
<p>He rose and walked briskly to the door.
Throwing it open he called a clerk and gave him
the two telegrams. He held the note in his hand
and asked the Bishop back into the office.</p>
<p>Closing the door quickly, he said without
preface:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This note will put my man up there at your
service. You will prefer to go up into the hills
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
yourself, I think. The officers in command of the
troops will know that you are empowered to act
for all parties. The Governor will have seen to
that before you get there, I think. There will
be no attempt at prosecutions, now or afterwards.
You can settle the whole matter in no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not buy the land, but we&rsquo;ll give a
fair rental, based on what ores we find to take
out. You can give <i>your</i> word&ndash;&ndash;mine wouldn&rsquo;t
go for much up there, I guess,&rdquo; he put in grimly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that
it will be fair. You can make that the
basis of settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can go back and rebuild. I will help,
where it will do the most good. Our operations
won&rsquo;t interfere much with their farm land, I find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will want to start at once. That is all,
I guess, Bishop,&rdquo; he concluded abruptly.</p>
<p>The Bishop reached for the smaller man&rsquo;s hand
and wrung it with a sudden, unwonted emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not cheapen this, sir,&rdquo; he said evenly,
&ldquo;by attempting to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mere whim of mine, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Stanton
cut in almost curtly, the steel-trap expression snapping
into place over his face. &ldquo;A mere whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Bishop slowly, looking him
squarely in the eyes, &ldquo;I only came to ask a question,
anyhow.&rdquo; Then he turned and walked
briskly from the office. He had no right and no
wish to know what the other man chose to conceal
beneath that curt and incisive manner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>So these two men parted. In words, they had
not understood each other. Neither had come
near the depths of the other. But then, what man
does ever let another man see what is in his
heart?</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>All day long the line of armed men had gone
spreading itself wider and wider, to draw itself
around the edges of the shorter line of men hidden
in the protecting fringe of the hills. All day
long clearly and more clearly Jeffrey Whiting
had been seeing the inevitable end. His line was
already stretched almost to the breaking point.
If the enemy had known, there were dangerous
gaps in it now through which a few daring men
might have pushed and have begun to divide up
the strength of the men with him.</p>
<p>All the afternoon as he watched he saw other
and yet other groups and troops of men come
up the railroad, detrain and push out ever
farther upon the enveloping wings to east and
west.</p>
<p>Twice during the afternoon the ends of his line
had been driven in and almost surrounded.
They had decided in the beginning to leave their
horses in the rear, and so use them only at the
last. But the spreading line in front had become
too long to be covered on foot by the few men he
had. They were forced to use the speed of the
animals to make a show of greater force than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
they really had. The horses furnished marks that
even the soldiers could occasionally hit. All the
afternoon long, and far into the night, the screams
of terrified, wounded horses rang horribly through
the woods above the pattering crackle of the irregular
rifle fire. Old men who years before had
learned to sleep among such sounds lay down and
fell asleep grumbling. Young men and boys who
had never heard such sounds turned sick with horror
or wandered frightened through the dark,
nervously ready to fire on any moving twig or
scraping branch.</p>
<p>In the night Jeffrey Whiting went along the
line, talking aside to every man; telling them to
slip quietly away through the dark. They could
make their way out through the loose lines of
soldiers and sheriffs&rsquo; men and get down to the villages
where they would be unknown and where
nobody would bother with them.</p>
<p>The inevitable few took his word&ndash;&ndash; There is
always the inevitable few. They slipped away
one by one, each man telling himself a perfectly
good reason for going, several good reasons, in
fact; any reason, indeed, but that they were afraid.
Most of them were gathered in by the soldier
pickets and sent down to jail.</p>
<p>Morning came, a grey, lowering morning with
a grim, ugly suggestion in it of the coming winter.
Jeffrey Whiting and his men drew wearily
out to their posts, munching dryly at the last of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
the stores which they had taken from the construction
depots along the line which they had destroyed.
This was the end. It was not far from
the mind of each man that this would probably be
his last meal.</p>
<p>The firing began again as the outer line came
creeping in upon them. They had still the great
advantage of the shelter of the woods and the
formation of the soldiers, while their marksmanship
kept those directly in front of them almost
out of range. But there was nothing in sight before
them but that they would certainly all be surrounded
and shot down or taken.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fire from below ceased. Those
who had been watching the most distant of the
two wings creeping around them saw these men
halt and slowly begin to gather back together.
What was it? Were they going to rush at last?
Here would be a fight in earnest!</p>
<p>But the soldiers, still keeping their spread formation,
merely walked back in their tracks until
they were entirely out of range. It must be a
ruse of some sort. The hill men stuck to their
shelter, puzzled, but determined not to be drawn
out.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting, watching near the middle of
the line, saw an old man walking, barehead, up
over the lines of half-burnt ties and twisted
rails. That white head with the high, wide brow,
the slightly stooping, spare shoulders, the long,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
swinging walk&ndash;&ndash; That was the Bishop of Alden!</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting dropped his gun and, yelling to
the men on either side to stay where they were,
jumped down into the roadbed and ran to meet the
Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are any men killed?&rdquo; the Bishop asked before
Jeffrey had time to speak as they met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Erskine Beasley was shot through the
chest&ndash;&ndash;we don&rsquo;t know how bad it is,&rdquo; said
Jeffrey, stopping short. &ldquo;Ten other men are
wounded. I don&rsquo;t think any of them are bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call in your men,&rdquo; said the Bishop briefly.
&ldquo;The soldiers are going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Jeffrey&rsquo;s call the men came running from
all sides as he and the Bishop reached the line.
Haggard, ragged, powder-grimed they gathered
round, staring in dull unbelief at this new appearance
of the White Horse Chaplain, for so one
and all they knew and remembered him. Men
who had seen him years ago at Fort Fisher slipped
back into the scene of that day and looked about
blankly for the white horse. And young men who
had heard that tale many times and had seen and
heard of his coming through the fire to French
Village stared round-eyed at him. What did this
coming mean?</p>
<p>He told them shortly the terms that Clifford
W. Stanton, their enemy, was willing to make with
them. And in the end he added:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You have only my word that these things will
be done as I say. <i>I</i> believe. If you believe, you
will take your horses and get back to your families
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in the weakness and reaction of relief,
the men for the first time knew what they had
been through. Their knees gave under them.
They tried to cheer, but could raise only a croaking
quaver. Many who had thought never to see
loved ones again burst out sobbing and crying
over the names of those they were saved to.</p>
<p>The Bishop, taking Jeffrey Whiting with him,
walked slowly back down the roadbed. Suddenly
Jeffrey remembered something that had gone
completely out of his mind in these last hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;that day&ndash;&ndash;that
day in court. I&ndash;&ndash;I said you lied. Now I know
you didn&rsquo;t. You told the truth, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the Bishop queerly, &ldquo;yesterday
I asked a man, on his soul, for the truth&ndash;&ndash;the
truth. I got no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I remembered that Pontius Pilate, in the
name of the Emperor of all the World, once
asked what was truth. And <i>he</i> got no answer.
Once, at least, in our lives we have to learn that
there are things bigger than we are. We get no
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey inquired no more for truth that day.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<h3>THAT THEY BE NOT AFRAID</h3>
</div>
<p>It was morning in the hills; morning and Spring
and the bud of Promise.</p>
<p>The snow had been gone from the sunny places
for three weeks now. He still lingered three feet
deep on the crown of Bald Mountain, from which
only the hot June sun and the warm rains would
drive him. He still held fastnesses on the northerly
side of high hills, where the sun could not
come at him and only the trickling rain-wash
running down the hill could eat him out from
underneath. But the sun had chased him away
from the open places and had beckoned lovingly to
the grass and the germinant life beneath to come
boldly forth, for the enemy was gone.</p>
<p>But the grass was timid. And the hardy little
wild flowers, the forget-me-nots and the little
wild pansies held back fearfully. Even the
bold dandelions, the hobble-de-hoys and tom-boys
of meadow and hill, peeped out with a wary circumspection
that belied their nature. For all of
them had been burned to the very roots of the
roots. But the sun came warmer, more insistent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
and kissed the scarred, brown body of earth and
warmed it. Life stirred within. The grass and
the little flowers took courage out of their very
craving for life and pushed resolutely forth.
And, lo! The miracle was accomplished! The
world was born again!</p>
<p>Cynthe Cardinal was coming up Beaver Run
on her way back to French Village. She had been
to put the first flowers of the Spring on the grave
of Rafe Gadbeau, where Father Ponfret had
blessed the ground for him and they had laid him,
there under the sunny side of the Gaunt Rocks
that had given him his last breathing space that
he might die in peace. They had put him here,
for there was no way in that time to carry him
to the little cemetery in French Village. And
Cynthe was well satisfied that it was so. Here,
under the Gaunt Rocks, she would not have to
share him with any one. And she would not have
to hear people pointing out the grave to each other
and to see them staring.</p>
<p>The water tumbling down the Run out of the
hills sang a glad, uproarious song, as is the way
of all brooks at their beginnings, concerning the
necessity of getting down as swiftly as possible
to the big, wide life of the sea. The sea would
not care at all if that brook never came down to
it. But the brook did not know that. Would not
have believed it if it had been told.</p>
<p>And Cynthe hummed herself, a sad little song
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
of old Beaupre&ndash;&ndash;which she had never seen, for
Cynthe was born here in the hills. Cynthe was
sad, beyond doubt; for here was the mating time,
and&ndash;&ndash; But Cynthe was not unhappy. The
Good God was still in his Heaven, and still good.
Life beckoned. The breath of air was sweet.
There was work in the world to do. And&ndash;&ndash;when
all was said and done&ndash;&ndash;Rafe Gadbeau was
in Heaven.</p>
<p>As she left the Run and was crossing up to
the divide she met Jeffrey Whiting coming down.
He had been over in the Wilbur&rsquo;s Fork country
and was returning home. He stopped and
showed that he was anxious to talk with her.
Cynthe was not averse. She was ever a chatty,
sociable little person, and, besides, for some time
she had had it in mind that she would some day
take occasion to say a few pertinent things to this
scowling young gentleman with the big face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re with Ruth Lansing a lot, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
he said, after some verbal beating about the bush;
&ldquo;how is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come see, if you want to
know?&rdquo; retorted Cynthe sharply.</p>
<p>Jeffrey had no ready answer. So Cynthe went
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to know why didn&rsquo;t you come
up all Winter and see? Why didn&rsquo;t you come
up when she was nursing the dirty French babies
through the black diphtheria, when their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
mothers were afraid of them? Why didn&rsquo;t you
come see when she was helping the mothers up
there to get into their houses and make the houses
warm before the coming of the Winter, though
she had no house of her own? Why didn&rsquo;t you
come see when she nearly got her death from
the &rsquo;mmonia caring for old Robbideau Laclair
in his house that had no roof on it, till she shamed
the lazy men to go and fix that roof? Did you
ask somebody then? Why didn&rsquo;t you come
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jeffrey defended, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
about any of those things. And we had plenty
to do here&ndash;&ndash;our place and my mother and all.
I didn&rsquo;t see her at all till Easter Sunday. I
sneaked up to your church, just to get a look at
her. She saw me. But she didn&rsquo;t seem to want
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she should have been delighted to see
you,&rdquo; Cynthe snapped back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
so? Certainly, she should have been overjoyed.
She should have flown to your arms! Not so?
You remember what you said to her the last time
you saw her before that. No? I will tell you.
You called her &lsquo;liar&rsquo; before the whole court, even
the Judge! Of one certainty, she should have
flown to you. No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now if Jeffrey had been wise he would have
gone away, with all haste. But he was not wise.
He was sore. He felt ill-used. He was sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
that some of this was unjust. He foolishly stayed
to argue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&ndash;&ndash;she cared for me,&rdquo; he blurted out.
&ldquo;I know she did. I couldn&rsquo;t understand why she
couldn&rsquo;t tell&ndash;&ndash;the truth; when you&ndash;&ndash;you did so
much for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you? For <i>you</i>!&rdquo; the girl flamed up in
his face. &ldquo;Oh, villainous monster of vanity! For
<i>you</i>! Ha! I could laugh! For <i>you</i>! I put
<i>mon Rafe</i>&ndash;&ndash;dead in his grave&ndash;&ndash;to shame before
all the world, called him murderer, blackened
his name, for <i>you</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! <i>No!</i> <i>Never!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not have said a word against him to
save you from the death. <i>Never!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;I did what I did, because there was a debt.
A debt which <i>mon Rafe</i> had forgotten to pay.
He was waiting outside of Heaven for me to pay
that debt. I paid. I paid. His way was made
straight. He could go in. I did it for <i>you</i>!
Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The theology of this was beyond Jeffrey. And
the girl had talked so rapidly and so fiercely that
he could not gather even the context of the matter.
He gave up trying to follow it and went back
to his main argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t she have told the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth, eh! You must have the truth!
The girl must tell the truth for you! No matter
if she was to blacken her soul before God,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
you must have the truth told for you. The truth!
It was not enough for you to know that the
girl loved you, with her heart, with her life, that
she would have died for you if she might! No.
The poor girl must tear out the secret lining of her
heart for you, to save you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you that if <i>mon Rafe</i> was alive and
stood there where you stood, in peril of his life;
think you that he would ask me to give up the
secret of the Holy Confession to save him. <i>Non!</i>
<i>Mon Rafe</i> was a <i>man</i>! He would die, telling me
to keep that which God had trusted me with!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of a Woodchuck! Who were you to
be saved; that the Good God must come down
from His Heaven to break the Seal of the Unopened
Book for <i>you</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask for truth! <i>Tiens!</i> I will tell you
truth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sat in the place of the prisoner and cried
that you were an innocent man. <i>Mon Rafe</i> was
the guilty man. The whole world must come
forth, the secrets of the grave must come forth
to declare you innocent and him guilty! You
were innocent! You were persecuted! The
earth and the Heaven must come to show that you
were innocent and he was guilty! <i>Bah!</i> <i>You
were as guilty as he!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there. I saw. Your finger was on
the trigger. You only waited for the man to stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
moving. Murder was in your heart. Murder
was in your soul. Murder was in your finger.
But you were innocent and <i>mon Rafe</i> was guilty.
By how much?</p>
<p>&ldquo;By one second. That was the difference between
<i>mon Rafe</i> and you. Just that second that
he shot before you were ready. <i>That</i> was the
difference between you the innocent man and <i>mon
Rafe</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were guilty. In your heart you were
guilty. In your soul you were guilty. M&rsquo;sieur
Cain himself was not more guilty than you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were more guilty than <i>mon Rafe</i>, for he
had suffered more from that man. He was
hunted. He was desperate, crazy! You were
cool. You were ready. Only <i>mon Rafe</i> was a
little quicker, because he was desperate. Before
the Good God you were more guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>mon Rafe</i> must be blackened more than
the fire had blackened his poor body. And the
poor Ruth must break the Holy Secret. And the
good M&rsquo;sieur the Bishop must break his holiest
oath. All to make you innocent!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! <i>Innocent!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung away from him and ran up the hill.
Cynthe had not said quite all that she intended to
say to this young gentleman. But then, also, she
had said a good deal more than she had intended
to say. So it was about even. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
said enough. And it would do him no harm.
She had felt that she owed <i>mon Rafe</i> a little plain
speaking. She was much relieved.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting stood where she had left him
digging up the tender roots of the new grass with
his toe. He did not look after the girl. He had
forgotten her.</p>
<p>He felt no resentment at the things that she had
said. He did not argue with himself as to
whether these things were just or unjust. Of all
the things that she had said only one thing mattered.
And that not because she had said it. It
mattered because it was true. The quick, jabbing
sentences from the girl had driven home to him
just one thing.</p>
<p>Guilty? He <i>was</i> guilty. He was as guilty as&ndash;&ndash;Rafe
Gadbeau.</p>
<p>Provocation? Yes, he had had provocation,
bitter, blinding provocation. But so had Rafe
Gadbeau: and he had never thought of Rafe Gadbeau
as anything but guilty of murder.</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and walked down the
Run with swift, swinging strides, fighting this conviction
that was settling upon him. He fought it
viciously, with contempt, arguing that he was a
man, that the thing was done and past, that men
have no time for remorse and sickish, mawkish
repentance. Those things were for brooding
women, and Frenchmen. He fought it reasonably,
sagaciously; contending that he had not, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
fact, pulled the trigger. How did he know that
he would ever have done so? Maybe he had not
really intended to kill at all. Maybe he would not
have killed. The man might have spoken to him.
Perhaps he was going to speak when he turned
that time. Who could tell? Ten thousand
things might have happened, any one of which
would have stood between him and killing the man.
He fought it defiantly. Suppose he had killed the
man? What about it? The man deserved it.
He had a right to kill him.</p>
<p>But he knew that he was losing at every angle
of the fight. For the conviction answered not a
word to any of these things. It merely fastened
itself upon his spirit and stuck to the original indictment:
&ldquo;As guilty as Rafe Gadbeau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he came over the top of the hill,
from where he could look down upon the grave of
Rafe Gadbeau there under the Gaunt Rocks, the
conviction pointed out to him just one enduring
fact. It said: &ldquo;There is the grave of Rafe
Gadbeau; as long as memory lives to say anything
about that grave it will say: a murderer was buried
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he fought no more with the conviction.
It gripped his spirit and cowed him. It sat upon
his shoulders and rode home with him. His
mother saw it in his face, and, not understanding,
began to look for some fresh trouble.</p>
<p>She need not have looked for new trouble, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
far as concerned things outside himself. For
Jeffrey was doing very well in the world of men.
He had gotten the home rebuilt, a more comfortable
and finer home than it had ever been.
He had secured an excellent contract from the railroad
to supply thousands of ties out of the timber
of the high hills. He had made money out
of that. And once he had gotten a taste of money-making,
in a business that was his by the traditions
of his people and his own liking, he knew that he
had found himself a career.</p>
<p>He was working now on a far bigger project,
the reforesting of thirty thousand acres of the
higher hill country. In time there would be unlimited
money in that. But there was more than
money in it. It was a game and a life which he
knew and which he loved. To make money by
making things more abundant, by covering the
naked peaks of the hill country with sturdy, growing
timber, that was a thing that appealed to him.</p>
<p>All the Winter nights he had spent learning the
things that men had done in Germany and elsewhere
in this direction, and in adding this knowledge
to what he knew could be done here in the
hills. Already he knew it was being said that
he was a young fellow who knew more about growing
timber than any two old men in the hills.
And he knew how much this meant, coming from
among a people who are not prone to give youth
more than its due. Already he was being picked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
as an expert. Next week he was going down to
Albany to give answers to a legislative committee
for the Forest Commission, which was trying to
get appropriations from the State for cleaning up
brush and deadfalls from out of standing timber&ndash;&ndash;a
thing that if well done would render forest
fires almost harmless.</p>
<p>He was getting a standing and a recognition
which now made that law school diploma&ndash;&ndash;the
thing that he had once regarded as the portal of
the world&ndash;&ndash;look cheap and little.</p>
<p>But, as he sat late that night working on his
forestry calculations, the roadway of his dreams
fell away from under him. The high colour of
his ambitions faded to a grey wall that stood before
him and across the grey wall in letters of
black he could only see the word&ndash;&ndash;<i>guilty</i>.</p>
<p>What was it all worth? Why work? Why
fight? Why dream? Why anything? when at
the end and the beginning of all things there stood
that wall with the word written across it.
Guilty&ndash;&ndash;guilty as Rafe Gadbeau. And Ruth
Lansing&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>A flash of sudden insight caught him and held
him in its glaring light. He had been doing all
this work. He had built this home. He had
fought the roughest timber-jacks and the high hills
and the raging winter for money. He had
dreamt and laboured on his dreams and built them
higher. Why? For Ruth Lansing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>He had fought the thought of her. He had
put her out of his mind. He had said that she
had failed him in need. He had even, in the
blackest time of the night, called her liar. He
had forgotten her, he said.</p>
<p>Now he knew that not for an instant had she
been out of his mind. Every stroke of work had
been for her. She had stood at the top of the
high path of every struggling dream.</p>
<p>Between him and her now rose that grey wall
with the one word written on it. Was that what
they had meant that day there in the court, she
and the Bishop? Had they not lied, after all?
Was there some sort of uncanny truth or insight
or hidden justice in that secret confessional of
theirs that revealed the deep, the real, the everlasting
truth, while it hid the momentary, accidental
truth of mere words? In effect, they had
said that he was guilty. And he <i>was</i> guilty!</p>
<p>What was that the Bishop had said when he
had asked for truth that day on the railroad line?
&ldquo;Sooner or later we have to learn that there is
something bigger than we are.&rdquo; Was this what
it meant? Was this the thing bigger than he was?
The thing that had seen through him, had looked
down into his heart, had measured him; was this
the thing that was bigger than he?</p>
<p>He was whirled about in a confusing, distorting
maze of imagination, misinformation, and
some unreadable facts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>He was a guilty man. Ruth Lansing knew that
he was guilty. That was why she had acted as
she had. He would go to her. He would&ndash;&ndash;!
But what was the use? She would not talk to
him about this. She would merely deny, as she
had done before, that she knew anything at all.
What could he do? Where could he turn?
They, he and Ruth, could never speak of that
thing. They could never come to any understanding
of anything. This thing, this wall&ndash;&ndash;with
that word written on it&ndash;&ndash;would stand between
them forever; this wall of guilt and the secret that
was sealed behind her lips. Certainly this was the
thing that was stronger than he. There was no
answer. There was no way out.</p>
<p>Guilty! Guilty as Rafe Gadbeau!</p>
<p>But Rafe Gadbeau had found a way out. He
was not guilty any more. Cynthe had said so.
He had gotten past that wall of guilt somehow.
He had merely come through the fire and thrown
himself at a man&rsquo;s feet and had his guilt wiped
away. What was there in that uncanny thing they
called confession, that a man, guilty, guilty as&ndash;&ndash;as
Rafe Gadbeau, could come to another man,
and, by the saying of a few words, turn over and
face death feeling that his guilt was wiped away?</p>
<p>It was a delusion, of course. The saying of
words could never wipe away Rafe Gadbeau&rsquo;s
guilt, any more than it could take away this guilt
from Jeffrey Whiting. It was a delusion, yes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
But Rafe Gadbeau <i>believed</i> it! Cynthe believed
it! And Cynthe was no fool. <i>Ruth</i> believed it!</p>
<p>It was a delusion, yes. But&ndash;&ndash;<i>What</i> a delusion!
What a magnificent, soul-stirring delusion!
A delusion that could lift Rafe Gadbeau
out of the misery of his guilt, that carried the
souls of millions of guilty people through all the
world up out of the depths of their crimes to a
confidence of relief and freedom!</p>
<p>Then the soul of Jeffrey Whiting went down
into the abyss of despairing loneliness. It trod
the dark ways in which there was no guidance.
It did not look up, for it knew not to whom or
to what it might appeal. It travelled an endless
round of memory, from cause to effect and back
again to cause, looking for the single act, or
thought, that must have been the starting point,
that must have held the germ of his guilt.</p>
<p>Somewhere there must have been a beginning.
He knew that he was not in any particular a different
person, capable of anything different, likely
to anything different, that morning on Bald Mountain
from what he had been on any other morning
since he had become a man. There was never
a time, so far as he could see, when he would not
have been ready to do the thing which he was
ready to do that morning&ndash;&ndash;given the circumstances.
Nor had he changed in any way since
that morning. What had been essentially his act,
his thought, a part of him, that morning was just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
as much a part of him, was himself, in fact, this
minute. There was no thing in the succession
of incidents to which he could point and say:
That was not I who did that: I did not mean
that: I am sorry I did that. Nor would there
ever be a time when he could say any of these
things. It seemed that he must always have been
guilty of that thing; that in all his life to come
he must always be guilty of it. There had been
no change in him to make him capable of it, to
make him wish it; there had been no later change
in him by which he would undo it. It seemed
that his guilt was something which must have begun
away back in the formation of his character,
and which would persist as long as he was the
being that he was. There was no beginning of
it. There was no way that it might ever end.</p>
<p>And, now that he remembered, Ruth Lansing
had seen that guilt, too. She had seen it in his
eyes before ever the thought had taken shape in
his mind.</p>
<p>What had she seen? What was that thing written
so clear in his eyes that she could read and
tell him of it that day on the road from French
Village?</p>
<p>He would go to her and ask her. She should
tell him what was that thing she had seen. He
would make her tell. He would have it from
her!</p>
<p>But, no. Where was the use? It would only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
bring them to that whole, impossible, bewildering
business of the confessional. And he did not
want to hear any more of that. His heart was
sick of it. It had made him suffer enough. And
he did not doubt now that Ruth had suffered
equally, or maybe more, from it.</p>
<p>Where could he go? He must tell this thing.
He <i>must</i> talk of it to some one! That resistless,
irrepressible impulse for confession, that call
of the lone human soul for confidence, was upon
him. He must find some other soul to share with
him the burden of this conviction. He must find
some one who would understand and to whom he
could speak.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting was not subtle. He could not
have analysed what this craving meant. He only
knew that it was very real, that his soul was staggering
alone and blind under the weight of this
thing.</p>
<p>There was one man who would understand.
The man who had looked upon the faces of life
and death these many years, the man of strange
comings and goings, the Bishop who had set him
on the way of all this, and who from what he had
said in his house in Alden, that day so long ago
when all this began, may have foreseen this very
thing, the man who had heard Rafe Gadbeau cry
out his guilt; that man would understand. He
would go to him.</p>
<p>He wrote a note which his mother would find in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
the morning, and slipping quietly out of the
house he saddled his horse for the ride to Lowville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came because I had to come,&rdquo; Jeffrey began,
when the Bishop had seated him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
why I should come to you. I know you cannot
do anything. There is nothing for any one to do.
But I had to tell some one. I <i>had</i> to say it to
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat that day in the courtroom,&rdquo; he went on
as the Bishop waited, &ldquo;and thought that the whole
world was against me. It seemed that everybody
was determined to make me guilty&ndash;&ndash;even you,
even Ruth. And I was innocent. I had done
nothing. I was bitter and desperate with the idea
that everybody was trying to make me out guilty,
when I was innocent. I had done nothing. I had
not killed a man. I told the men there on the
mountain that I was innocent and they would not
believe me. Ruth and you knew in your hearts
that I had not done the thing, but you would not
say a word for me, an innocent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that as much as anything, that feeling
that the whole world wanted to condemn me knowing
that I was innocent, that drove me on to the
wild attack upon the railroad. I was fighting
back, fighting back against everybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;this is what I came to say&ndash;&ndash;all the
time I was guilty&ndash;&ndash;guilty: guilty as Rafe Gadbeau!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure I understand,&rdquo; said the Bishop
slowly, as Jeffrey stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing to understand. It is just
as I say. I was guilty of that man&rsquo;s death before
I saw him at all that morning. I was guilty of it
that instant when Rafe Gadbeau fired. I am
guilty now. I will always be guilty. Rafe Gadbeau
could say a few words to you and turn over
into the next world, free. I cannot,&rdquo; he ended,
with a sort of grim finality as though he saw again
before him that wall against which he had come
the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the Bishop began slowly.
Then he asked suddenly, &ldquo;What brought your
mind to this view of the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, &ldquo;the girl that saved me;
that French girl that loved Rafe Gadbeau. She
showed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, thought the Bishop, Cynthe has been relieving
her mind with some plain speaking. But he
did not feel at all easy. He knew better than to
treat the matter lightly. Jeffrey Whiting was not
a boy to be laughed out of a morbid notion, or to
be told to grow older and forget the thing. His
was a man&rsquo;s soul, standing in the dark, grappling
with a thing with which it could not cope. The
wrong word here might mar his whole life. Here
was no place for softening away the realities with
reasoning. The man&rsquo;s soul demanded a man&rsquo;s
straight answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Before you could be guilty,&rdquo; said the Bishop
decisively, &ldquo;you must have injured some one by
your thought, your intention. Whom did you injure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting leaped at the train of thought,
to follow it out from the maze which his mind
had been treading. Here was the answer. This
would clear the way. Whom had he injured?</p>
<p>Well, <i>whom</i> had he injured? <i>Who</i> had been
hurt by his thought, his wish, to kill a man? Had
it hurt the man, Samuel Rogers? No. He was
none the worse of it.</p>
<p>Had it hurt Rafe Gadbeau? No. He did not
enter into this at all.</p>
<p>Had it hurt Jeffrey Whiting, himself? Not till
yesterday; and not in the way meant.</p>
<p>Whom, then? And if it had hurt nobody, then&ndash;&ndash;then
why all this&ndash;&ndash;? Jeffrey Whiting rose
from his chair as though to go. He did not look
at the Bishop. He stood with his eyes fixed unseeing
upon the floor, asking:</p>
<p>Whom?</p>
<p>Suddenly, from within, just barely audible
through his lips there came the answer; a single
word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>God!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your business is with Him, then,&rdquo; said the
Bishop, rising with what almost seemed brusqueness.
&ldquo;You wanted to see Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but,&rdquo; Jeffrey Whiting hesitated to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
argue, &ldquo;men come to you, to confess. Rafe Gadbeau&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Bishop quickly, &ldquo;you are
wrong. Men come to me to <i>confession</i>. They
come to <i>confess</i> to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the young man&rsquo;s hand, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not say another word. You have found
your own answer. You would not understand better
if I talked forever. Find God, and tell Him,
what you have told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the night Jeffrey Whiting rode back up the
long way to the hills and home. He was still bewildered,
disappointed, and a little resentful of the
Bishop&rsquo;s brief manners with him. He had gone
looking for sympathy, understanding, help. And
he had been told to find God.</p>
<p>Find God? How did men go about to find
God? Wasn&rsquo;t all the world continually on the
lookout for God, and who ever found Him? Did
the preachers find Him? Did the priests find
Him? And if they did, what did they say to
Him? Did people who were sick, and people who
said God had answered their prayers and punished
their enemies for them; did they find God?</p>
<p>Did they find Him when they prayed? Did
they find Him when they were in trouble? What
did the Bishop mean? Find God? He must
have meant something? How did the Bishop
himself find God? Was there some word, some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
key, some hidden portal by which men found God?
Was God to be found here on the hills, in the
night, in the open?</p>
<p>God! God! his soul cried incoherently, how
can I come, how can I find! A wordless, baffled,
impotent cry, that reached nowhere.</p>
<p>The Bishop had once said it. We get no answer.</p>
<p>Then the sense of his guilt, unending, ineradicable
guilt, swept down upon him again and
beat him and flattened him and buffeted him. It
left him shaken and beaten. He was not able to
face this thing. It was too big for him. He was
after all only a boy, a lost boy, travelling alone in
the dark, under the unconcerned stars. He had
been caught and crushed between forces and passions
that were too much for him. He was little
and these things were very great.</p>
<p>Unconsciously the heart within him, the child
heart that somehow lives ever in every man, began
to speak, to speak, without knowing it, direct
to God.</p>
<p>It was not a prayer. It was not a plea. It was
not an excuse. It was the simple unfolding of the
heart of a child to the Father who made it. The
heart was bruised. A weight was crushing it. It
could not lift itself. That was all; the cry of helplessness
complete, of dependence utter and unreasoning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></div>
<p>Suddenly the man raised his head and looked at
the stars, blinking at him through the starting
tears.</p>
<p>Was that God? Had some one spoken?
Where was the load that had lain upon him all
these weary hours?</p>
<p>He stopped his horse and looked about him,
breathing in great, free, hungry breaths of God&rsquo;s
air about him. For it <i>was</i> God&rsquo;s air. That was
the wonder of it. The world was God&rsquo;s! And it
was new made for him to live in!</p>
<p>He breathed his thanks, a breath and a prayer
of thanks, as simple and unreasoning, unquestioning,
as had been the unfolding of his heart. He
had been bound: he was free!</p>
<p>Then his horse went flying up the hill road,
beating a tattoo of new life upon the soft, breathing
air of the spring night.</p>
<p>With the inconsequence of all of us children
when God has lifted the stone from our hearts,
Jeffrey had already left everything of the last thirty-six
hours behind him as completely as if he had
never lived through those hours. (That He lets
us forget so easily, shows that He is the Royal
God in very deed.)</p>
<p>Before the sun was well up in the morning
Jeffrey was on his way to French Village, to look
out the cabin where Ruth had cared for old Robbideau
Laclair, and had shamed the lazy men into
fixing that roof.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>What he had heard the other day from Cynthe
was by no means all that he had heard of the
doings of Ruth during the last seven months.
For the French people had taken her to their
hearts and had made of her a wonderful new kind
of saint. They had seen her come to them out of
the fire. They had heard of her silence at the
trial of the man she loved. They had seen her
devoting herself with a careless fearlessness to
their loved ones in the time when the black diphtheria
had frightened the wits out of the best of
women. All the while they knew that she was not
happy. And they had explained fully to the
countryside just what was their opinion of the
whole matter.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, remembering these things, and suddenly
understanding many things that had been hidden
from him, was very humble as he wondered what
he could say to Ruth.</p>
<p>At the outskirts of the little unpainted village he
met Cynthe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asked without preface.</p>
<p>Cynthe looked at him curiously, a long, searching
look, and was amazed at the change she
saw.</p>
<p>Here was not the heady, thoughtless boy to
whom she had talked the other day. Here was a
man, a thinking man, a man who had suffered and
had learned some things out of unknown places of
his heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></div>
<p>I hurt him, she thought. Maybe I said too
much. But I am not sorry. <i>Non.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The last house,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;by the crook
of the lake there. She will be glad,&rdquo; she remarked
simply, and turned on her way.</p>
<p>Jeffrey rode on, thanking the little French girl
heartily for the word that she had thought to add.
It was a warrant, it seemed, of forgiveness&ndash;&ndash;and
of all things.</p>
<p>Old Robbideau Laclair and his crippled wife
Philomena sat in the sun by the side of the house
watching Ruth, who with strong brown arms bare
above the elbow was working away contentedly
in their little patch of garden. They nudged each
other as Jeffrey rode up and left his horse, but
they made no sign to Ruth.</p>
<p>So Jeffrey stepping lightly on the soft new earth
came to her unseen and unheard. He took the
hoe from her hand as she turned to face him. Up
to that moment Jeffrey had not known what he
was to say to her. What was there to say? But
as he looked into her startled, pain-clouded eyes
he found himself saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hurt God once, very much. I did not know
what to say to Him. Last night He taught me
what to say. I hurt you, once, very much. Will
you tell me what to say to you, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a surprising, disconcerting greeting.
But Ruth quickly understood. There was no irreverence
in it, only a man&rsquo;s stumbling, wholehearted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
confession. It was a plea that she had no
will to deny. The quick, warm tears of joy came
welling to her eyes as she silently took his hand
and led him out of the little garden and to where
his horse stood.</p>
<p>There, she leaning against his horse, her fingers
slipping softly through the big bay&rsquo;s mane, Jeffrey
standing stiff and anxious before her, with the glad
morning and the high hills and all French Village
observing them with kindly eyes, these two faced
their question.</p>
<p>But after all there was no question. For
when Jeffrey had told all, down to that moment in
the dark road when he had found God in his heart,
Ruth, with that instinct of mothering tenderness
that is born in every woman, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy, you have suffered too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I suffered was that I made for myself,&rdquo;
he said thickly. &ldquo;Cynthe Cardinal told me what
a fool I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Cynthe tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me that you loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you need to be told that, Jeffrey?&rdquo; said
the girl very quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it seems so. I&rsquo;d known your little white
soul ever since you were a baby. I knew that in
all your life you&rsquo;d never had a thought that was
not the best, the truest, the loyalest for me. I
knew that there was never a time when you
wouldn&rsquo;t have given everything, even life, for me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
I knew it that day in the Bishop&rsquo;s house. I knew
it that morning when you came to me in the sugar
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew all that,&rdquo; he went on bitterly.
&ldquo;I knew you loved me, and I knew what a love it
was. I knew it. And yet that day&ndash;&ndash;that day
in the courtroom, the only thing I could do was
to call you liar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put up her hands with an appeal to stop him,
but he went on doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. That was all I could think of.
I threw it at you like a blow in the face. I saw
you quiver and shrink, as though I had struck you.
And even that sight wasn&rsquo;t enough for me. I
kept on saying it, when I knew in my heart it
wasn&rsquo;t so. I couldn&rsquo;t help but know it. I knew
you. But I kept on telling myself that you lied;
kept on till yesterday. I wasn&rsquo;t big enough. I
wasn&rsquo;t man enough to see that you were just facing
something that was bigger than both of us&ndash;&ndash;something
that was bigger and truer than words&ndash;&ndash;that
there was no way out for you but to do
what you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey, dear,&rdquo; the girl hurried to say, &ldquo;you
know that&rsquo;s a thing we can&rsquo;t speak about&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can, now. I know and I understand.
You needn&rsquo;t say anything. I <i>understand</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I understand a lot more,&rdquo; he began
again. &ldquo;It took that little French girl to tell me
what was the truth. I know it now. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
a deeper, a truer truth under everything. That
was why you had to do as you did. That&rsquo;s why
everything was so. I wasn&rsquo;t innocent. Things
don&rsquo;t <i>happen</i> as those things did. They work out,
because they have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was watching him with fright and
wonder in her eyes. What was he going to say?
But she let him go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t innocent,&rdquo; he said, as though to
himself now. &ldquo;I fooled myself into thinking that
I was. But I was not. I meant to kill a man.
I had meant to for a long time. Nothing but
Rafe Gadbeau&rsquo;s quickness prevented me. No, I
wasn&rsquo;t innocent. I was guilty in my heart. I was
a murderer. I was guilty. I was as guilty as
Rafe Gadbeau! As guilty as Ca&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had suddenly sprung forward and
thrown her arms around his neck. She caught
the word that was on his lips and stopped it with
a kiss, a kiss that dared the onlooking world to say
what he had been going to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not say that!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;I
will not let you say it! Nobody shall say it! I
defy the whole world to say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the boy brokenly as
he held her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true! Never! Nothing&rsquo;s true, only
the truth that God has hidden in His heart!
And that is hidden! How can we say? How
dare we say what we would have done, when we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
didn&rsquo;t do it? How do we know what&rsquo;s really in
our hearts? Don&rsquo;t you see, Jeffrey boy, we cannot
say things like that! We don&rsquo;t know! I
won&rsquo;t let you say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you do say it,&rdquo; she argued, &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ll
have to say it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I. Do you remember that night you
were in the sugar cabin? I was outside looking
through the chinks at Rafe Gadbeau. What was
I thinking? What was in my heart? I&rsquo;ll tell
you. I was out there stalking like a panther. I
wanted just one thing out of all the world. Just
one thing! My rifle! To kill him! I would
have done it gladly&ndash;&ndash;with joy in my heart! I
could have sung while I was doing it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;now, if you&rsquo;re going to
say that thing, why, we&rsquo;ll say it together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big boy, holding the trembling girl closer
in his arms, understood nothing but that she
wanted to stand with him, to put herself in whatever
place was his, to take that black, terrible
shadow that had fallen on him and wrap it around
herself too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor little white-souled darling,&rdquo; he said
through tears that choked him, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take this
from you! It&rsquo;s too much, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little the girl relaxed, tiredly, against
his shoulder and argued dreamily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you can do. You&rsquo;ll have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
take <i>me</i>. And I don&rsquo;t see how you can take me
any way but just as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she was suddenly conscious that the world
was observing. She drew quickly away, and
Jeffrey, still dazed and shaken, let her go.</p>
<p>Standing, looking at her with eyes that hungered
and adored, he began to speak in wonder and
self-abasement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all I&rsquo;ve made you suffer&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ruth would have none of this. It had been
nothing, she declared. She had found work to
do. She had been happy, in a way. God had
been very kind.</p>
<p>At length Jeffrey said: &ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;ll
never have to misunderstand again, anyway, Ruth.
I had to find God because I was&ndash;&ndash;I needed Him.
Now I want to find Him&ndash;&ndash;your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;you mean that you <i>believe</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jeffrey slowly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I
ever would. I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to. But I
do. And it isn&rsquo;t just to win with you, Ruth, or
to make you happier. I can&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s the
thing the Bishop once told me about&ndash;&ndash;the thing
that&rsquo;s bigger than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Ruth, all zeal and thankfulness, was for
leading him forthwith to Father Ponfret, that he
might begin at once his course of instructions
which she assured him was essential.</p>
<p>But Jeffrey demurred. He had been reading
books all winter, he said. Though he admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
that until last night he had not understood much
of it. Now it was all clear and easy, thank God!
Could she not come home, then, to his mother,
who was pining for her&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and they would
have all their lives to finish the instructions.</p>
<p>On this, however, Ruth was firm. Here she
would stay, among these good people where she
had made for herself a place and a home. He
must come every week to Father Ponfret for his
instructions, like any other convert. If on those
occasions he also came to see her, well, she would,
of course, be glad to see him and to know how he
was progressing.</p>
<p>Afterwards? Well, afterwards, they would
see.</p>
<p>And to this Jeffrey was forced to agree.</p>
<p>Old Robbideau Laclair, when he heard of this
arrangement, grumbled that the way of the heretic
was indeed made easy in these days. But his wife
Philomena, scraping sharply with her stick, informed
him that if the good Ruth saw fit to convert
even a heathen Turk into a husband for herself
she would no doubt make a good job of it.</p>
<p>So love came and went through the summer,
practically unrebuked.</p>
<p>Again the Bishop came riding up to French
Village with Arsene LaComb. But this time they
rode in a jogging, rattling coach that swung up
over the new line of railroad that came into the
hills from Welden Junction. And Arsene was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
very glad of this, for as he looked at his beloved
M&rsquo;sieur l&rsquo;Eveque he saw that he was not now the
man to have faced the long road up over the hills.
He was not two, he was many years older and less
sturdy.</p>
<p>The Bishop practised his French a little, but
mostly he was silent and thoughtful. He was
remembering that day, nearly two years ago now,
when he had set two ambitious young souls upon
a way which they did not like. What a coil of
good and bad had come out of that doing of his.
And again he wondered, as he had wondered then,
whether he had done right. Who was to tell?</p>
<p>And again to-morrow he was to set those two
again upon their way of life, for he was coming up
to French Village to the wedding of Ruth Lansing
to Jeffrey Whiting.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Whiting knelt by Ruth Lansing&rsquo;s side in
the little rough-finished sanctuary of the chapel
which Father Ponfret had somehow managed to
raise during that busy, poverty-burdened summer.
But Jeffrey Whiting saw none of the poor makeshifts
out of which the little priest had contrived
a sanctuary to the high God. He was back again,
in the night, on a dark, lone road, under the unconcerned
stars, crying out to find God. Then
God had come to him, with merciful, healing touch
and lifted him out of the dust and agony of the
road, and, finally, had brought him here, to this
moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>He had just received into his body the God of
life. His soul stood trembling at its portal, receiving
its Guest for the first time. He was
amazed with a great wonder, for here was the
very God of the dark night speaking to him in
words that beat upon his heart. And his wonder
was that from this he should ever arise and go on
with any other business whatever.</p>
<p>Ruth Lansing knelt, adoring and listening to
the music of that <i>choir unseen</i> which had once
given her the call of life. She had followed it, not
always in the perfect way, but at least bravely, unquestioningly.
And it had brought her now to a
holy and awed happiness. Neither life nor death
would ever rob her of this moment.</p>
<p>Presently they rose and stood before the Bishop.
And as the Shepherd blessed their joined hands he
prayed for these two who were dear to him, as
well as for his other little ones, and, as always,
for those &ldquo;other sheep.&rdquo; And the breathing of
his prayer was:</p>
<p>That they be not afraid, my God, with any fear;
but trust long in Thee and in each other.</p>
